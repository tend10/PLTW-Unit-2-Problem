inavabb~Boring, Flat, Over the top, Inconsistent~Don't know where to start. Ok, I did not make it to the end. I left at 20m before the end. Could not watch it anymore. Violence violence violence, in a very inconsist way. The year is 10.000 and something. The city and the army look greater than great. But they are still fighting with swords. Sometimes the big guns, but no handhelds. The south of the planet is largely unknown. Would be a piece of cake by then. The Fremen have very sophisticated weapons, while they seem to live in primitive shelters in the rocks. And more of such. The casting is not very convincing, to my opinion. Chani does well, but other main characters are mediocre at best. The characters are pretty flat. OK, it is not that kind of movie, but it could have been better.~3/10~13 March 2024
dimitri_jason~Epic epicness~Absolutely loved watching this in the cinema . Absolutely loved every film this man has made so far, but Dune part 1 was his peak for me before this one. All I have thought about since watching it is maybe going to the cinema to see it again, which I haven't done since "the return of the king". This is Epic cinema at its best , the cinematography, the story, the character development, the action ... The action is just on its own level , so raw, swift and well done , if you blink you will miss it at the pace that it's happening. No slo mo rubbish needed. The visuals ,the world that was built in the first one, it's still unwrapping in this one . Seeing more of the worlds and learning more, if you are not familiar with the books, which I am not. The world building in the first one was what I found most intriguing and I'm happy to report that it is just as good in part 2. To top it all off , Hans Zimmer has created a score so iconic for this film again . His music makes the film come alive and stay in your head well after you have left the cinema. I hope for a part 3 that wraps up this incredible story told by this incredibly visionary director.~10/10~13 March 2024
kingcampbell-86422~Excellent film~I could write a big long explanation but frankly, it's just the best time I've had at a theatre in a long time. This movie is excellent. It's a complete film. Acting, writing, action, drama, etc, etc. It's all there and top notch. I cannot wait for the third film. ...even though it looks like we'll have to for a little while. I plan on watching it a couple more times in theatre before it leaves. I loved the old Dune but I can honestly say it's one of the few remakes that I prefer to the original. I love the universe and I care about the characters. Which is something very rare these days. I hope this gets spin offs as well.~10/10~13 March 2024
kylelichty-98010~An incredible sensory achievement~Dune part 2 is one of the best looking and sounding movies (if not the best) ever created. Everything pertaining to the overall feel of the movie is an absolute achievement. The intro scene sets to stage for what can only be described as a modern day masterpiece of filmmaking. That being said, I feel this movie falls short in similar ways to part 1, specifically the "battle" sequence at the end of the movie which had the opportunity to go down as one of the greatest battles of all time yet failed to deliver and was incredibly rushed. The pacing through the middle half to 2/3 of the movie felt slow, I feel like they could have pulled 10 minutes out of that section and made a more powerful battle/ ending sequence to the movie. Additionally, the character Feyd Harconnen felt a bit underdeveloped given the effort put into his exposition scene. All in all, a must see and one of the better releases in recent memory.~8/10~13 March 2024
bryvill~Visual Effects at its best!~I'm one of the few who sees the movie as an "ok" but not "wow" factor! When I saw part 1, it doesn't click to me at all irregardless I'm very open to any plot fact or fiction flick, and after seeing part 1 I said to myself I'll never watch the sequel if it comes out, and yes we all now this sequel went out and saw one of the highest reviews given, so given a chance to see it as it might flip side my not so good reviews, but after seeing the sequel, it was the same as the previous one, yes, visual effects were at its best as always, action scenes were great, actors were excellent at their acting skills but the plot, and its connection for me was still not there, if you ask me, you may or may not watch the flick.~5/10~13 March 2024
ashishranjan-20109~Great Visual Spectacle, loose story telling~The visual and auditory spectacle is brilliant. But dune is about the journey of self realization. The central core of Dune is around the sleeper must awaken dialogue which is not captured in both parts. Only David Lynch's movie captures that essence. I would urge everyone to watch David Lynch version before this. Also, some scenes are very anticlimatic. Certain characters have been downpoured into something they are not as seen in part one. Some scenes have been elongated way too much and some scenes requiring more context have been cut short. Dune book series is an epic. An epic needs nurturing of all characters. Even if the movie is nurturing only the central character, the essence of the character is missing.~7/10~13 March 2024
mselby-01342~The Making of a Legendary Series~This is a fantastic film, worthy of Oscar recognition in nearly every aspect. Unlike its predecessor, which occasionally felt sluggish due to extensive story setup, this sequel strikes a perfect balance between action and necessary plot development, capturing my attention throughout. The film excels in every department-acting, makeup, wardrobes, cinematography, and sound effects are all exceptional. A highlight for me is the CGI, which has evolved to astonishing levels of realism. The visual effects, especially the simultaneous depiction of futuristic tech alongside ancient architecture, are so convincing that they blur the lines between fiction and reality. This movie is an absolute must-see, and I wouldn't be surprised if it emerges as a top contender for movie of the year. I'm very excited for the next, and potentially last, film in this series as I think the whole will be up there as one of the greatest of all time.~10/10~13 March 2024
deiant~Perfection~This movie is by far the best movie i've seen in 2024, after seeing the movie once it had me wanting to go back and watch it again, this movie was made for the cinema, everything about the movie was great and this movie is definetly one of the best sequels i've seen in a very long time. Also after watching this movie i went straight to read the books which is very weird cause i hate reading but it just shows how good this movie really was. If you have'nt already seen it please do because this movie was made for cinema, you do not see movies like this often and i can't wait to go and watch it a 100 times when it's avaivable to buy at home.~10/10~13 March 2024
svynronin~Slow to Fast~"It's better to go slow in the right direction than to go fast in the wrong direction." Simon Sinek. This movie is very different from the first movie. While it starts off with the same tone and pacing with Paul and his mom mixing with the Fremen people, it shifts to Paul leading the Fremen while his mom goes south to sew belief in Paul as their Messiah. Paul wins over the Fremen people and this is where the pacing and cut scenes become a bit of a mess. Parts of the movie pick up, while other parts move at a snails pace. Scenes of Paul and the Fremen people attacking the Harkonnens come and go so quickly that it becomes difficult to enjoy them. The background of the Harkonnen planet and the Baron's nephew are slow and seem unnecessary. Not sure an exposition on how terrible the Harkonnen and the Baron's nephew are necessary after we came to know them from the first movie. The movie then significantly speeds up and cut scenes are more rapid and short. This causes pacing issues. Once Paul heads south the movie becomes a bit of a mess. One scene he's on a worm heading south, then he's running into the temple drinking worm juice and becoming poisoned, then Chani flies in on an ornithopter, it happens so fast the audience may mistake it for one of his visions. Where did they get an ornithopter? When did Chani learn to fly one? Why is Paul running into the temple? The pacing and cutting is so fast it becomes rushed, which is directly opposite of the first half of the movie. The final battle happens so fast it's hard to enjoy it. It just becomes such a rushed mess that it almost feels like a cliff notes version of what really happens. There is little to no involvement of Paul and Chani at the end of the movie. It almost feels as if they should have done yet another movie to give us more action and backstory on Paul's relationship with his mother while in the south, and his relationship with Chani before the end. The revenge scenes fall flat due to the fast pacing and lack of build up. Overall a good movie but it starts slow, but then speeds up and moves away from character building, plot development, to rush to an end.~8/10~13 March 2024
szovati~Slower paced, too talky but still a decent film~A) I dont know why the felt necessary to stretch out what was shown in the original DUNE 1984 into a 2 part, 7-8 hour saga. Oh, wait. I DO know - MONEY! So, this thing is going to be milked to the very last drop. B) For a revenge film, they couldve added more action or battle scenes but instead the film chooses to talk. C) The Baron from DUNE 1984 blows this one away and so did the original emperor played by Jos√© Ferrer ( he LOOKED more like an emperor, Walken looks like he wandered in from the Ben Hur film stage) Then again all of Lynchs actors had character & style. D) The film, again, has its great visuals although the ending seemed rushed. - the final battle was over in about a minute. E) Zendaya is the stand out for me - I am no fan whatsoever of her and I thought she was just gonna drag the movie down as the love interest. She plays a really solid freman. So, overall is it a good movie? Yes, compared to the garbage that has been put out since 2020. Would I pay to see it in the theater? Yes, at almost 3 hours you'll get your moneys worth.~7/10~13 March 2024
ashmithnandy~Epic, Awesome~This movie is a great continuation of the prequel, and it's a film that everyone should watch. Almost everything about the movie is at it's best. The movie is long, which I think is good, cause it's a massive story. The story is exciting and great from the start till the finish. The movie also has good graphics in it, and it feels like pure natural art. The music is absolutely amazing, I believe this is one of the best works of Hans Zimmer and his team. All the actors have done a great job when it comes to acting, cause everything felt so real, as if the events were happening for real. The movie lacks emotionality, which I think is not an issue, but I'm hoping that Dune Part 3 will be emotional. At the end, I really loved Dune 2, and I'm very excited for Dune 3 whenever it comes out. I believe that Dune 3 will more epic, exciting and amazing than what we've seen in Dune 2. It's my request for everyone to go and watch Dune 2, cause it's epic, awesome, great, amazing and still so much more to praise.~9/10~13 March 2024
griplegend~My 8/10 rating might be a little on the low side here's why.~The pacing and love story was a bit annoying for me. Particularly the scenes which felt like you're watching a teen love story at times. Retrospectively, since I watched this a week or so ago, they still do annoy me and it hurt's the rewatch I reckon. I feel as though the scenes are just filler for what's to come. It does make sense but I don't know that having the love story, and having so many scenes dedicated to it is really necessary for the audience to understand their relationship. There are better ways of doing this. For me to give this film a 10/10 there would need to be better, more visual and thought provoking interest in the scenes where they are with each other, for the first half of the film it feels like it's just about two teens in love. The entire first half of dune can feel a little slim on content because of the focus on these two. The last half makes up for it, to be clear. No doubt the lack of dialog at times is a great thing..But I still wish... anywho. 8/10. Will do a rewatch. The beauty of this film is it feels like you're in the cinemas for ages. Halfway through I didn't want to ever leave the cinema. Feels like a 5 hour film, but you get out and it's only been 3 hours! Amazing. My other gripes however is sometimes the camera cuts a little earlier than expected for a particular scene in the first half of the film. I think this was intentional rather than lazy editing, but who knows. It's a clever use of the budget to both have slim content in first half of the film then cut scenes early and to make the viewer feel like the story is always moving... you think "oh wait we're not done looking here" then it's already cut to the next scene. It's just different. I kind of like it.~8/10~13 March 2024
AzimAzimzade~Long Live Cinema~I was always jealous people who watched Lord of the Rings, The Dark Knight and other epic trilogy or single movies in cinema. Dune is the epic masterpiece of our generation which you can see spectacular performances by incredible talented actors. Really enjoyed to watch Rebecca Ferguson, Timothee Chalamet, Charlotte Rampling and others. Denis Villeneuve is one of my favorite director and Greig Fraser did an amazing job as cinematographer which should be appreciated. And Hans Zimmer... If Hans Zimmer is composer of a film, it means that I will watch that movie at least for the music. I got goosebumps, various feelings which was great experience in cinema. The scripts and story which is based on phenomenal book makes me more excited as it seems it is an example of pure sci/fi genre movie but you can also see philosophical, religious, psychological points. I would like to see more epic battle and fight scene especially when Gurney take a revenge or Paul and his favorite cousin fight. It is impossible to put everything on a film because it is a huge universe but editing would be better in this point. If you have a chance, try to experience this stunning movie as possible as on the big screen. Because I genuinely believe that after 30 years, we will feel special and privileged to watch it in cinema.~10/10~13 March 2024
gettodamoofies~"Power over spice is power over all."~FILM: 9.0 Denis Villeneuve returns to the world of Dune, affirming his status as an auteur in the process. It's something I always suspected would be the case; he simply hasn't had the opportunity to demonstrate it until now. With Dune: Part Two, he solidifies his position as a master storyteller. Having laid the expositional groundwork and world-building in the first film, Villeneuve now delves deeper into character development. He expands his palette, intertwining explorations of culture, religion, and politics seamlessly into the narrative while maintaining a brisk pace of action. Performances across the board are stellar. Timoth√©e Chalamet shows considerable growth, both as an actor and in his portrayal of Paul Atreides. Rebecca Ferguson's expanded role is a welcomed addition, adding a touch of menace. However, it's Javier Bardem's performance that truly shines, infusing the lengthy film with heart and humour. Villeneuve's direction proves that what was once deemed unfilmable is not only achievable but can be a triumph of filmmaking. The grandeur of the desert landscapes, the intricacies of the political machinations, and the emotional depth of the characters are all brought to life with stunning precision. My first watch of Dune: Part Two was an immersive and unforgettable experience. Villeneuve's vision, coupled with outstanding performances and breathtaking visuals, creates a cinematic near-masterpiece that transcends its genre. It's a testament to the power of storytelling and solidifies Dune as a modern classic. With its compelling narrative and thought-provoking themes, this film is a must-watch for cinephiles and casual viewers alike.

rottentowers-63027~High in the running for best film of the past twenty-four years, but missed potential holds it back~I will get this out there right now. Denis Villeneuve made a big mistake by altering the events of the second half of Dune. He is not nearly as disrespectful to the author nor the audience as Peter Jackass and his pretending to be a Tolkien fan. But the choice Villeneuve has made hurt his telling of the story to such a degree that I am flabbergasted that he made it. Essentially, Dune the novel has a few years pass between the assault upon House Atreides and Paul Atreides' Fremen-assisted return punch. During this time, his sister is born. The event of Jessica drinking the Water Of Life and then being told she should not have done so happens more or less exactly as depicted here, but we see that Alia Atreides is able to speak in whole sentences and walk unaided at ages where normal Humanoid children are struggling to make singular words and stand upright. Villeneuve's change to the story hurts it not because of anything to do with Alia, but because the timetable of Paul responding to House Harkonnen's power slap with a once-punch knockout using the Fremen as a fist becomes impossible this way. Jessica is shown being approximately eight months pregnant at the end of the film. Assuming that Paul sensed her pregnancy in the first week, this gives Paul nine months to: * Ingratiate himself enough with the Fremen for them to follow him into battle en masse * Disrupt spice production to such an extent that the reserves the Harkonnen keep are no longer enough to keep the Landsraad from taking notice * Go from indifferent to receiving offers of sex from Chani (admittedly, depending on many factors, this is plausible in the given time period) * Develop enough skill in worm riding to make the Fremen see him as their equal or even Messiah I think you see where this is going. Put simply, too many events are compressed into a small timeframe, and the credulity suffers a lot for it. Knowing that Villeneuve loves Dune, calls it Star Wars for grown-ups (and rightly so), but he could have stood to turn the first novel into a three-film series and he would still have to leave out some pieces of the story. We get a slew of new characters, including the much speculated-about Feyd Rautha, the character Sting checks under the bed for at night. If you have not seen the Flying Underpants, consider yourself lucky. Or unlucky if you are into that sort of thing. Anyway, Feyd Rautha is depicted beautifully and gets exactly the screentime he needs to fulfil his function in the story. Unfortunately, he is the only new character in this piece that we can say that about. Princess Irulan is barely developed beyond "daughter of the Emperor". Even her function as a historian and one of the sources people in the far future will read when seeking an account of the events in these films is something you could not possibly know of unless you read the novel. The only reason she needs to be in the story is, as said, she gets half of her DNA from the Emperor. Speaking of the Emperor, he is barely in the story. We learn that he is saddened by having had to send House Atreides to their doom, that the current unrest on Arrakis is bothering him, that it threatens his rule, but again, the only reason he cannot be cut from the story is because he has one essential function, to be overthrown, and the other details really only tie into that. L√©a Seydoux gets the worst of it. Lady Margot Fenrig is so superfluous it makes me weep. The one scene she does anything in involves subjecting Feyd Rautha to the same test Paul underwent in the beginning of Part One. One could simply remove her and give this scene to Princess Irulan or some anonymous nobody character, and the impact would not change. This hurts development of a connection with these new characters, and the nearly nonexistent screen time of returning characters such as Gurney Halleck or Glossau Rabban undermines the connection we had with them if we saw them in Part One. So what makes Dune: Part Two great? The collective aspects where Villeneuve once again hits it out of the park. The conflict between believers in the religious vomit planted by the Bene Gesserit and those who see it for what it is, although not central to the story, is a steady Billy Gould bass pattern throughout the film. In spite of the mishandling of the timeline, Lady Jessica's contribution to the story is as powerful as ever. She might not be commanding huge men to kill each other, but she is having no less of an impact upon the world around her. And Paul, well, the whole story revolves around Paul now, and he tears into it like an autoimmune disorder into healthy tissue. Paul is described in the novel as being fourteen years old when first he sets foot on Arrakis, and is around seventeen to eighteen years old at the conclusion of said novel. From an emotional perspective, Paul seems to be the exception to the bungling of the timetable. But hey, moments of incredible violence and threat to one's existence age a man up a bit (I know). The choice to make all outdoor scenes on Geidi Prime an offensively bright monochrome, the return of the masterful rendition of Ornithopter wings, the fact that Villeneuve knows how to construct a scene of violence, the masterful environmental storytelling, it all comes back and reminds us of why Dune: Part One left us wanting more. The difference is that Dune: Part One left us wanting more of a story that is unassailable from a logic and worldbuilding point of view. But what we get in Part Two is still masterful. Probably my favourite aspect would be that in spite of the timeline, the actions of the characters both make absolute sense in context of their circumstances and come from a place of intelligently processing the available information. Baron Harkonnen in particular demonstrates this, by taking control of Arrakis away from Glossau Rabban and giving it to Feyd Rautha, still under the assumption that there are a lot less Fremen than is truly the case, and totally ignorant of the bucket of napalm he has kicked into a pool of nuclear waste. If you are a fan of Dune, in the sense that you get the message of the story and understand its style (hey, certain director who everyone mistakes for understanding Tolkien, it is about consequences), Part Two is a must-watch. But people who have only seen the Part One film will walk away confused by the dropping of the timeline ball, and that is a problem for people who are familiar enough with Frank Herbert's novels to know that everything Paul does in Part One, Part Two, and Part Three will have repercussions that continue for another ten thousand years. See it twice. Regardless of what I have to say, it is really good for your brain.~9/10~13 March 2024
RickyB0bby12~Sequel is a masterpiece~This sequel is a masterpiece of art, looking at its peers like Avengers Endgame this has created its own stratosphere. The slow churn of the part I sets this film to create what Marvel took a dozen films to do. Although I must admit when I rewatched Part I I still felt like so many bits didn't stick, the planet, the race, all the family names. I felt like this didn't impact me for Part II, like any piece of Art it's better to appreciate more than once and over time. It makes me think, this is like if Star Wars was created again from today, pure escape, pure cinema. The visual and sound effects (Hans Zimmer) are perfect, not a futuristic city, just a desert wasteland captured in its essence. Just know, not every film maker can pull off riding giant worms. Flowers have to be given to the casting and acting, each of these charectors stretch further into the best they can be. Timothee Chamelet's arc is spot on, Austin Butler makes a great psychopath. My favourite has to be Javier Bardem (Jilgar) who turns from a Jedi master of his craft to an absolute religious zealot, humorous throughout. And let's not forget, as transported as I was throughout the quickest 3 hours of my life, many of this films themes of belief, power and control are clearly show influence from what happens in the real world. Just wish I got the popcorn bucket.~9/10~13 March 2024
welshone-17339~Beautiful, but...~Positives out of the way first: this film is gorgeous. The scenes under Giedi Prime's black sun are so beautiful that it's almost a shame when the Arrakis colour returns. The stark contrast is perfect for the two warring houses. Everyone plays their roles well; I adored Javier Bardem's devout Stilgar and Zendaya's defiant Chani. Of course, this is definitely Timothee Chalamet's film, though Austin Butler steals every scene he's in. So what are the problems? Well, I understand that it's hard to adapt such a huge novel into just two movies. The pacing felt right, up to a point; another movie would have been just right, imo. And doing away with the character of Alia (cameo and womb-voice notwithstanding), that feels like a mistake to me. When I read the book, it felt like Alia was the most dangerous character in the whole story, the culmination of the Bene Gesserit's scheming. I understand it's hard to find a young actor who could pull that off (they'd need Fanning levels of maturity) but there were surely ways around it, rather than just omitting her altogether. Chani and Paul's relationship was also rushed. Again, I understand not wanting to add in young Leto, but I think condensing the second movie into a few months was a mistake, especially when Princess Irulan comes on the scene; it gives the impression Chani was simply a fling, when she absolutely wasn't. TL;DR: If I hadn't read the book, this would be a 10. I would watch it again tomorrow, but I will always be disappointed at the lack of time skip and all that comes with it.~8/10~13 March 2024
tuxuday~Film making at its best~Wow. The action sequences, BGM are stunning. If one follows Dennis, his movies are big screen worthy. Was satisfied about the time & money spent. Had to travel an hour to find a better screen as the screens near my place are either small or didn't have dolby atmos. Feyd Rauth's birthday scenes are mesmerizing. Costumes are good. Acting is good too. I didn't follow Timothee, was not entirely satisfied with this performance in part 1. He could met the level reqd. In part 2. Not happy with casting of Zendaya. Rebaca, Austin. Skarsgard are perfect for their roles. Brolin is wasted. Enjoy masterpiece like this.~10/10~13 March 2024
espanajacob~Film not a movie~Whoever says film is dead, show them this. I can't believe what I witnessed tonight. I'm not a big movie person I do love movies but haven't reviewed or criticized any of them. I just can't stop thinking about this movie how good every single actor did to portray their role. The way the director made sure everything was perfect, and just visually spectacular! I have nothing bad to say about this film, the sound was perfect the sights I noticed my eyes expand to their fullest at most of these scenes I had to remind myself to blink! I hate reviews like this because I feel others may feel I'm exaggerating, but watch this film for yourself and tell me I'm wrong!~10/10~13 March 2024
solmcneil-80687~Dune Part 2~As someone that took a little longer to get round to dune part 2, I was a bit worried that all the good things I'd heard about it were going to be great exaggerations. I was pleasantly surprised and happy to be wrong, Dune part two is on a scale that is akin to Lord of the Rings. Now all the slow-burn, but necessary, universe-building of the first part has taken place, part two can hit the ground running. It must be remembered that this is a "part two", as a result a viewing of the first film is essential to understanding the themes and seeds that were planted in the first part. As this is a non-spoiler review I won't detail what these themes are, I shall just reassure that they are followed up in full.~10/10~13 March 2024
liamnoble1~A big come down in quality compared to Part 1~"Dune: Part 2" had the weight of expectation upon its shoulders, following the success of its predecessor. However, this highly anticipated sequel falls short of achieving the same level of excellence. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film struggles with uneven pacing, lackluster character development, and a narrative that feels rushed and heavy-handed. One of the glaring issues with "Dune: Part 2" is its pacing, which oscillates between dragging in the middle third and rushing through the final third. The film spends too much time on inconsequential events, leaving little room for character arcs to develop organically. Paul's transformation from a reluctant leader to a megalomaniac zealot feels particularly rushed and lacking in depth, robbing the audience of the opportunity to truly empathize with his journey. Having attended a late evening showing there were times I was actually checking my watch, unbelievably so, but I have to admit myself bored particularly past the first hour mark. Rather than feeling a drama play out in real time, we're simply told drama 'is' playing out. Its a subtle but important difference, but one which needs to be acknowledged. Unfortunately there is no sense of stakes here, instead its just characters accomplishing one task after the other until Paul can eventually become 'The Messiah'. At no point did I ever feel this was under threat, yet apparently according to what the characters are saying, that's EXACTLY how I should be feeling. Another one of my main complaints was the love story between Paul and Chani, with it feeling forced and clich√©d to the nth degree. The lack of chemistry between the two actors was distracting and the on-again, off-again nature of their romance detracted from the emotional weight their relationship is apparently supposed to carry. It's a narrative thread that we've seen countless times before, yet done better in other movies, leaving viewers feeling indifferent rather than invested; I had no real reason to care about these two, other than I was told I was supposed to by the plot. We can call Dune Part 2 a masterpiece all we want, but when the main romance and arguably main backdrop of the second installment feels corny, then we know we've got problems. The introduction of Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha character also feels unnecessary and cartoonish. His role usurps that of Dave Bautista's Beast Rabban from the world-building of the first film, only to be disposed of by the end of the sequel. This decision undermines the tension that could and probably SHOULD have been built with Bautista's character and leaves audiences questioning the purpose of Butler's inclusion. Feyd Rautha felt 'evil for the sake of evil' and a mere device to give the hero's of Paul and Chani something to aim at, whilst not actually threatening to alter the plot. Despite these shortcomings, "Dune: Part 2" does have its strengths, particularly in its visual effects, framing, and atmosphere. Denis Villeneuve once again proves himself a master of his craft, creating stunning visuals that transport audiences to the world of Arrakis. However, these moments of visual brilliance can sometimes feel overindulgent, with scenes of desert landscapes and thumpers dragging on for longer than necessary. Credit where credit is due however.... Ultimately, "Dune: Part 2" fails to deliver a satisfying payoff, with the Emperor's defeat feeling anticlimactic and Christopher Walken's portrayal lacking the gravitas it deserves. While the film runs for a lengthy time, almost none of it is given towards developing his character and giving the audience a reason to care about his potential affect and inclusion in the narrative. Unfortunately he just exists here as a confused looking old man, and the film is poorer for it. In conclusion, "Dune: Part 2" is a visually impressive but a narratively underwhelming sequel. While it may have been hailed as a masterpiece by some, it ultimately fails to live up to its potential. Those seeking to immerse themselves in the world of "Dune" would be better off sticking to the books, as the film leaves much to be desired, particularly given its lengthy runtime. As a non book reader myself, I sure know where I'll be heading now to get my Dune fix.~6/10~13 March 2024
peterkettle-904-444717~DUNE, as dull as sand can be.~Dune 2 is about as dull and depressing and hopeless as an epic film can be. No script made a prime mess of things. A hopeless but supremely well made chunk of cinema. And it is only worth seeing in a cinema if you must see it. A great music score - Hans Zimmer - and fabulous production values do not make a great film. Not a trace of character, wit, irony or charm. Everyone was starkly good or bad, and dull as dishwater. No nuance, no thrills. I did not want to know anyone in it, wanted to sleep with nobody, talk with them, or identify with any aspect of any character. It is as dull as Triumph Of The Will, and almost as fascistic.~2/10~13 March 2024
boorzoyeff~Shockingly amazing~I really didn't notice how the first two hours quickly past by. It past by so quick that I don't really remember what happened. The last hour really got me, though. I mesmerized by the details in a way that I forgot to eat my popcorn. I think, other people also enjoyed the movie in the way that I did. There was a lady that shouted at me, sit down, as I was blocking her view as I past by to my sit. This is the first time that such thing happened to me. And it is worth mentioning that I live in a small city in Canada that all people are super kind and sweet. Overall, my friends and I enjoyed the movie in different ways. Within an hour of finishing the movie me and my friends, we were shocked.~9/10~13 March 2024
troyrweaver~A bit slow with an oddly flowing plotline~This movie is absolutely worth the watch. It is super anticipated, unbelievably well made, visually stunning, and pushes the boundaries of modern entertainment. However, it is a very long movie, and I couldn't help but struggle to focus on it for the first couple hours. The scenes jump from one to another in an almost discrete fashion, there is very little continuity in the plot, and this leaves the viewer guessing. This definitely contributed to the cinematic feel of the movie especially when paired with the amazing visual effects. However, I could not help but feel like I just wanted to fast forward to the end of the movie so I could watch the inevitable climax that we all knew was coming. I get that the slow feel is necessary to flush out the characters and narrative, but I wish that the story telling in this aspect was more thorough so that I felt like I needed to listen to it. The ending was amazing, and the movie absolutely set the backdrop for what I assume will be another film. So maybe this is a steppingstone for something that will hopefully be much better.~7/10~13 March 2024
Dvir971~The Sci-Fi/Fantasy Epic of our Generation~Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away. As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well. Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does. In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters. The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon. I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again. Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre. Extremely recommended.~10/10~26 February 2024
Orr971~The perfect sequel. Enchanting.~Denis Villeneuve obviously takes Dune very seriously. As it peaks up right where Part One left off, we remain with 1.5 acts that's left of what I refer to as the Dune Duo. A Part 3 is of course necessary but until we get one, it's a duo. And then it fits perfectly: Part One is 1.5 acts of the story and we're left with a dazzling display of intensity. Hans Zimmer continues what he many times referred to as a project that is really close to him, and it shows. After releasing additional 2 albums full of almost 4 hours of music besides the official Dune Part One soundtrack, he continues his quest for the true soul of Dune (in my opinion) - the music. Which leads me to my next point: you HAVE TO watch it in IMAX. It will blow you away. My popcorn box was literally vibrated by the bass, and some parts of the film were so visually stunning that I was quite literally jaw dropped. Without giving anything away, Dune Part 2 is just magnificent.~10/10~26 February 2024
Ellimof~WOW! I need Dune Messiah now.~If you liked or loved the first one, the same will apply for this one. Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer. For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally. I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress. I guess that's pretty much every category now that I've typed it out lol.~10/10~26 February 2024
nickventura-98896~Incredible Film~Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey, and I was completely blown away. From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored, which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film. I don't want to write too much here, I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately. It doesn't release worldwide until March 1st, so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible. Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras. This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar's for sound editing, picture, etc., and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically. Like I stated in the beginning, see this film!~9/10~26 February 2024
eotbruh~Star Wars of the 2020's~I had the joy of watching this movie early, and was nothing short of amazed. Simply put this movie is one of the best crafted, and most impressive films I have ever seen. The casting is spectacular, and the massive character arcs that are displayed masterfully are as well. The camera angles are creative and unique, showcasing multiple landscapes in fascinating new ways (even surpassing the quality of Dune part One). This movie gave me the chills often and was reminiscent of the original three Star Wars movies in a way. Both franchises paved the way for something entirely new, and showcase revolutionary film techniques that are sure to dazzle and inspire audiences for years to come. This movie was one of the best I have ever seen and I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to sit through a three hour long movie.~10/10~26 February 2024
Eb04~Absolutely stunning~I just watched this in IMAX and it was one of the greatest movie experiences I have ever had. Everything from part one was done even better in part two and the story was much more interesting. The outfits were so unique and really well made. Whenever I thought it was starting to move a little slow something insane happens and I'm instantly drawn back into the world of dune that Denis has remade and expanded on so much. All the shots of the different worlds were just breathtaking. The last hour of the movie is by far some of the best made cinema in awhile and the action was so good. The last fight was awesome as well. "You fought well Atreides."~9/10~26 February 2024
reelfilmophile~Masterclass in grand spectacle~I have said that Denis Villeneuve is a master of putting grand spectacle on screen. Dune: Part 2 was an outsized enhancement of its predecessor. Seeing it in IMAX helped bring the massive landscape of this film into scope for the viewer. Greig Fraser is a master cinematographer. The camera work, coupled with the special effects, have created a world that evokes a visceral feeling of realism. The stunning visuals were accompanied with a beautiful score to guide emotions and tactful sound design that was vociferous in nature but also withdrawn when it needed to be. Believable choreography & acting to boot. A star-studded cast that never outshines their characters - only once I kind of got taken out of the movie by a character and it was because of weird line delivery. The story was drawn out but never felt like it was dragging. A fantastic experience with a crowd & another cinematic achievement to add to Denis' filmography that will surely bring him more awards. P.s. Javier Bardem was having a TIME with his role & Austin Butler showed off his range as an actor. Also, loved the surprise cameo from an actress who is starring in another big movie this year! P.s.s. Can I make "ride the worm" a commonly used phrase without it being misconstrued as dirty? This is a clear early 2025 Oscar candidate for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Design, Best Editing, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Score. ...potential in acting categories as well...~10/10~26 February 2024
michellexinma~Truly a masterpiece~After watching the advanced screening, we were blown away by Part 2 of Dune. It continues seamlessly after Part 1, with the same masterful soundtracks, action scenes and acting. The movie flew by despite it being almost three hours. The pacing was incredibly well done and nothing felt too fast or too slow. The CGI was incredibly realistic and the characters were portrayed so well by the lead actors. The chemistry between the characters felt so real - nothing felt fake or forced. It's truly difficult finding a movie that contains everything - flawless screenplay, writing, sound, acting and pacing, but Dune 2 does it all. One of the best movies of 2024 for sure.~10/10~26 February 2024
loganmerrill~It's an experience~Just got out of the early access screening, and all I can say is wow. Truly blew my mind, from start to finish, the film keeps the foot on the gas peddle and doesn't allow you to breath even for a second. The arena has got to be one of my favourite scenes in any movie, the cinematography, colour, score and performance by Butler is truly a sight to behold. Outstanding performances by Timothe and Butler, with Timothe showing his range throughout the course of the movie, morphing into the thing he tries to avoid the most, and Butler playing the psychopath amazingly well. One you want to see in IMAX, memorable experience.~10/10~26 February 2024
guslopes-75373~Denis Villeneuve Promises and Delivers~This movie more than accomplished all of the promises it set out, absolutely mesmerizing experience. I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timoth√©e Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts. Overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didn't even enjoy the first installment of the series.~10/10~26 February 2024
awessel-58117~A masterpiece, a pillar of sci-fi/fantasy~This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having. This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene. This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. 10/10.~10/10~26 February 2024
davideminorjr~Heavy Spoilers for book readers:~It was a packed house for the February 25 fan premiere and the film did not disappoint. Since the first film, several like myself have read the books and now we're going to compare --- because that's what happens when an IP gets famous, i.e. Most of us didn't compare GOT season 1 to ASOIAF when we first watched it. Alia is not in the film. At all, except as a fetus who speaks to Jessica. So of course she doesn't kill the Baron. It actually works out. From a filmmaking point, good luck finding a child who could do justice to the role, even if you age her up. Jessica, in my opinion, becomes the villain after drinking the water of life. She essentially manipulates Paul into become the Mahdi. It was previously ambiguous as to her birthing a son, and by extension the Kwizatch Haderach, was due to love or vanity. This would almost now appear to be the latter. Again, just my opinion, but I don't believe the water changed her, more likely it awakened a dormant ambition. Chani is by far the most improved character from the books. With all respect to Frank Herbert, she didn't really do much. She was the love interest and ultimately the mother of the Tyrant and that pretty much sums up her relevance in the Dune Saga. She is still all that of course, but while she loves Paul, she's an outspoken cynic concerning him being a Messiah. This was a welcome change. Stilgar is exactly what he was at the end of the first book but all that throughout. I am mildly disappointed. Nevertheless, he is the most comedic character. Paul kills the Baron. Chani breaks up with him (kinda). The door is wide open for part 3. Those are the most significant changes from the book. I would encourage anyone to watch it and not allow these to detract from your enjoyment. Everyone did a great job on the film as a whole and of course it's a 10!~10/10~26 February 2024
tcbvxyxc~movie of the year, undoubtedly~Visually stunning, gripping acting, and an insane story this movie was actually so good i cried 3 times at some of the beautiful shots. SPOILERS AHEAD the worm riding scene... was absolutely crazy and so memorable, making me already want to rewatch just an hour after leaving the theater. Austin butlers performance was brilliant and the fight between him and paul... just so good. This may just become one of the top trilogies of all time, competing with the likes of the lord of the rings and the original star wars films. Only time will tell but for now i am in awe with how much better it was than the first.~10/10~26 February 2024
christianreedbrown-65145~The Dark Knight and Empire Strikes Back of our generation...~I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible. See for yourself in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts. Overall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema.~10/10~26 February 2024
FeastMode~Another entry that doesn't entirely stand on its own~Dune: Part Two is on par with the first in nearly every aspect. However you felt about the first one is likely how you will feel about this sequel. It's a visual and auditory explosion of beauty and the technical aspects are all pristine. Directing, cinematography and music are elite. And they continue to build the cast with great new additions. But just like with Part One, the lack of story progression is noticeable. We don't get the ups and downs of a three-act structure. It feels like one act stretched out to 165 minutes. Again we don't seem to really have a climax. I didn't feel the emotional resonance or investment in the story and characters. And I didn't entirely grasp character motivations, like why a character does something or why another is upset about it. With Part One, I was a lot more forgiving of it not being able to completely stand on its own. But now it's getting a little frustrating. Also, the PG-13 limitations are glaring. (1 viewing, early fan screening IMAX 2/25/2024)~6/10~26 February 2024
akshajk8~Absolutely Stunning Cinematic Experience~Just got out of an early screening in IMAX 70mm and it was amazing. The visuals and CGI in this film were excellent and it was cinematographically better than Dune Part 1 even. A lot happens in this movie story-wise and the pacing was very good. Denis Villeneuve uses beautiful filmmaking techniques and the end result is just stunning. The contrast between one black and white scene and the rest of the movie being colored was a brilliant move and really leaves the audience's mouth hanging and hair standing up in suspense. There are many twists/surprises in the story and they are all executed flawlessly. I never felt bored in this movie. The action scenes and the sword/knife fighting scenes were also very well choreographed and it was definitely refreshing to see. This movie was much better than Dune Part 1 in terms of story, cinematography, CGI, and everything else, and this movie definitely sets up Dune 3 in a perfect way. Overall, the movie was fantastic, a must-watch, and I HIGHLY recommend watching it in IMAX.~10/10~26 February 2024
AfricanBro~Long live the fighters~Phenomenal stuff. I'll probably calm down tomorrow but right now my heart's beating like crazy and my brain's screaming it's a bloody masterpiece. This is one of the few movies that I didn't try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways. "Power over spice is power over all"- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It's a cinematic experience; I can't imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere. When Part One came out people said it was "game of thrones in space", I wasn't really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV's Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all. However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One's focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can't spell their names lol), and the Baron's family. Despite the emperor's pulling the strings, the Baron's family still felt like main antagonist to me. The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn't tell, I was absolutely immersed in it. I absolutely loved the kind "The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi." Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn't expecting any humour. It's funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I'd already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn't spoil a thing. The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul's changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me. Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn't really get as much screen time as you'd think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team's suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn't wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times. Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon. One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he's depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different. Loved Austin butler though, I wasn't sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting 'the water of life' had some insane calves on her, I'm extremely jealous. While I was initially not convinced about Timoth√©e Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I'd not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie's end. Zendaya's portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character. We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the "water of life" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me. I think watching this movie at home won't do it justice, it's clearly made for the big screens if you can. It's pretty epic and I think it'll remain memorable as one of 2024's best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it.~9/10~26 February 2024
greenml~A Masterclass in Science Fiction.~It seems that many movies have become increasingly longer and longer and we groan and bemoan this fact. But Dune Part II left me wanting more. I would love to see an extended edition of this film. It is a film that is visually and sonically stunning. Go and see it on the biggest screen as possible. Fans of the book may find elements of this adaptation frustrating as it does take a few major deviations from the book. Yet the film captures the very essence of the novel and brings to life the wild fanaticism of the Fremon people, whose long awaited messiah emerges. This is among some of the most compelling and invigorating storytelling ever brought to life on the big screen. Does it surpass Dune Part One? Yes. What about Star Wars or Empire Strikes Back. I don't think so but let me go and watch it again and again before I make such an assessment. I am already considering a second and third viewing of this movie. Maybe even a fourth. Go and Watch this movie. It is mesmerizing.~9/10~26 February 2024
johnnymay-36676~Perfect theatrical sequeal~When I first watched Dune two years ago I couldn't get enough of the story or the surrounding lore. I read the first book soon after as to immerse myself in knowing what would happen next and to have a better knowledge of the universe. At the time in my mind the first part missed out on some things that I felt were important in establishing the overall story, however after watching the second part I understand what Denis Villeneuve's vision cinematically needed to go a slightly different direction. The battles in the second part were epic and all of the added stuff of Paul training was a fun experience. I'm sad to see the whole story arc of Thufir Hawat as well as Paul's child and his bizarre sister being dropped, but I understand that when it comes to adapting a novel to the big screen that some things aren't as necessary/needed to build for future installments. I loved this movie, it was such a great sequel and is helping further the vision of Frank Herbert.~10/10~26 February 2024
her5066~This is what Hollywood needs!~This is what Hollywood needs. A great story with a great director/producer. After that the best thing a studio can do is get the hell out of the way and let artists create art. Dune Part 2 is creative, beautiful, tragic, and mesmerizing. Never once did I get bored or anticipate what was going to happen next. I haven't read the book so I have nothing to compare it to. Denis Villeneuve continues to amaze me with the effort he puts into each of his films. The acting in this film was top notch too. We saw it in IMAX and the sound was earth shattering. If you're gonna see this movie, see it on the largest screen possible.~10/10~26 February 2024
reaganreviews~I might buy the Dune popcorn bucket...~Austin Butler sheds his Elvis accent while Timothee Chalamet continues to sharpen his jawline as the Fremen's messiah. Dune: Part Two is an absolute sci-fi masterpiece. Director Denis Villeneuve expertly builds upon the solid foundation laid by the first film injecting politics, religion, and romance. The acting here is fantastic with standouts being Austin Butler, who is psychotic and creepy as Feyd-Rautha, along with Rebecca Ferguson, who takes on something totally different than the last film's characterization of Lady Jessica. Greig Fraser is also a standout as the cinematographer along with the entire vfx team. This group is incredibly talented, using a very limited color palette to create stunningly realistic sandworms, spaceships, and otherworldly armies. The sound mixing department and Hans Zimmer's score also work hand in hand to create an oddly pleasing yet deafening IMAX theater experience. This film is so loud and grand. I also respect how Denis Villeneuve is sticking to his guns that he had while filming Sicario: he doesn't want to glorify the violence as he wants to show its effects on its victims. While the film is visually stunning, the violence is what it is. It's brutal and not over the top. Overall, Dune showcases the best sci-fi has to offer with a great adaptation of Frank Herbert's space drama created with top tier acting and production.~9/10~26 February 2024
walkerschindler~INSANELY GOOD!!~Incredibly grateful to have seen this as it was released! Feels like I got to see Star Wars or Lord of the Rings on opening night!! Absolutely stunning! I read the books and fell in love! After the first movie I was so happy that Denis Villeneuve did the book justice and prayed that the second would live up to it. It exceeded it by far. I genuinely have no complaints. Despite knowing what was going to happen from reading the books I was on the edge of my seat still questioning the outcome of fight scenes. The casting was spot on, the music was incredible, the visuals were insane, and the cinematography was legendary. I can't wait to see more in the next film.~10/10~26 February 2024
s-15230~Great production but don't expect anything deeper~(8/10) Watching it on an IMAX screen is definitely the best way to enjoy the film. It shows the best CG and production level of Hollywood. The battle scenes are generally quite ceremonial and impressive. The storytelling is smooth. However, the whole setting of shield defense in part 1 is completely abandoned. I haven't finished the novel, but I heard it's a quite in-depth one. In Part 2 of Dune, there are not many deep implications regarding either colonization or environment, even family relationships. There is only Paul's unavoidable fate to become a ruthless tyrant. @ Cineplex Riverport IMAX.~8/10~26 February 2024
aurumthewise~Cinematic Masterpiece~Cinematography is visually stunning and awe inspiring. The sound design is incredible, especially of the weaponry. The rifle shots look and sound futuristic yet realistic. Captures the essence of the book while cutting out superfluous parts of the book and also avoiding some of the controversial stuff like the Harah character. The entire cast nail their performances. I do wish Denis left in the ecology bits but I understand runtime had to be kept to a reasonable length. Ending was changed to be more female empowering than the book I guess. Chani overall was a bit more independent and less "submissive." In the book Chani accepts some "traditional" gender roles while in the movie it clear that Chani is never subservient to Paul. I knew they would "update" the story for today's society so the changes expected.~10/10~26 February 2024
