marc_zwahlen~OMG!~Soooo epic. Religion, Love, Drama and war. Everything ist in it and on an epic scale. The pictures are stunning and the music breathtaking. Ist futuristic and on the other Hand also very basic and the Story itself could also play in the middle age. The Main Thema are timeless and very interesting. The Characters and the the Artists playing Them are amazing and very Deep. Ist mystic and from an other world but yet it picks up themes we know all to well from our everyday life. Watched it in IMAX and it was the best Cinema experience in a Long Long Times. It for sure is a 5/7 and i would recommend it to everyone.~10/10~16 March 2024
meminas-80894~Dune part two~The planet Arrakis, the planet where war, thirst and betrayal are located, was truly well-crafted and beyond perfect. Its sounds, music and visuals are beyond legendary. I felt chills during Paul's screaming scenes. I really liked the scenes of the worms coming to the surface and attacking. They left the door open for the third movie. I'm looking forward to it. Paul at war with the dynasties.' I'm very curious about what path he will follow, and I'm looking forward to seeing Chani's reaction, whether he will marry the emperor's daughter. I think the film was much better than the previous film, its cinematography was perfect, it will definitely win at least 7 awards at the 2024 Oscars.~10/10~16 March 2024
arfdawg-1~Disappointing Compared to Part One~I really liked Dune Part One. So much so I saw it three times in the theater and twice streaming. I was really looking forward to Part Two. Aw it last night and it was a bit of a disappointment for me. I felt that this movie relied way more heavily on loud special effects like explosions and fire power than the character exploration of Part One. Saw this is Dolby Cinema. Sometimes the music and the sound track was louder than the actors and it was hard to hear what they were saying. It made it hard to follow what was happening. And then there were a couple of other things: The Stilgar character was reduced to a fanatical buffoon. It seemed out of character from how Bardem delivered him in Part One. And oh, how about Zendaya? If this was the first time I saw her on screen I'd say keep your day job. For some reason her character was reduced to literally one facial expression the entire 2 hours and 45 minutes! It was bizarre. Don't get me wrong, however, I still liked the movies and there were some scene that were truly top notch. I just think Part One is measurably better.~7/10~16 March 2024
apon9401~Not so-great~This is became what if an American writer takes on historical referances from religious viewpoint & a director make with vision & style. Casts will surely be nominated for next academy award. VFX, CGI & BGM was too good. In my opinion, Hans Zimer put his best on this. A thoroughly theatrical extravaganga. It may be bit dull to watch at home. But, there are some negative parts also. Ending seemed rushed. Powerful antagonists were killed very easily. Not as grand as was teased at part 1. Remained incomplete for part 3. Last but not the least, some melodrama like things added unnecessarily. So, it's good but not great for me.~8/10~16 March 2024

moonlightdevvv~Masterpiece (as written)~I don't often give out 10 stars or call movies "masterpieces" but this one did it for me. I have watched a lot of movies that are over 2 hours long, and yet not one of them had me super focused for the whole duration. The cinematography was very beautiful, not overstimulating, especially considering the length of the film. I especially liked the visuals throughout the film, such as when Alia was speaking to her mother or when Jessica drank the holy poison. Scenes like that help with the pacing a lot as well, helping the audience with information processing. Now, when looking at the soundtracks, I don't have that much to say. I mean, it is Hans Zimmer. Great overall, will definitely be listening to some of those in my free time. The costumes were super beautiful, adding that futuristic vibe and also helping us differentiate between the houses. Good cast and good acting. I especially loved the fighting scenes/ war scenes. That is how you create art when you combine good acting, good CGI and good storylines.~10/10~16 March 2024
rasmusac-66642~What did I miss?~I do t get it, the movie was epic and stunning to watch, but it lacked plot and agency. It feels like the first thing that happened was after the first hour. If I walked into the cinema after one hour, I wouldn't have missed a single point of the story. There was even a great recap of the first movie in part 2, so that I almost didn't need to have watched it. With the slow walk to the predictable point of no return, the movie still managed to feel very rushed in the end. At the base it was a great story, but way too long. Why even spend so long time with side characters that doesn't impact the movie much? This is a movie that actually could have used a montage of character development instead of the torture of time just passing by.~6/10~16 March 2024
sagor-9364~Messiah of the dystopian sci-fi era!!~"Paul Usul Muad'dib Mahdi Lisan Al Gaib Atreides"!! That's a lot of name for one person!! Anyways, all fun aside, a solid sequel to the first film. The visuals as promised were superb!! This is taking the best visual effect and best sound oscar, no doubt about it. And Timothee Chalamet also put up a heck of a performance, which should get him an oscar nomination at the very least. This is definitely one for the theatres, a must watch film to enjoy at the theatres with stunning visuals, story telling and sound effects. Many unanswered questions remain which hopefully will be cleared in the future sequels!~8/10~16 March 2024
thejefflewis-92228~Visually stunning, but emotionally flat~I saw Dune 2 on an XD screen and sound system. Visually, Dune 2 was jaw dropping. The sound was intense, and at times, too loud and droning. If you are interested in seeing this movie, it is worth seeing on a big screen. Though I was fully engaged for its 2 hour and 46 minute run time, I would not call Dune 2 a masterpiece. Most characters acted emotionally flat. I also felt the romance between Pual and Chani was not convincing. When the story was reaching its climax, I did not care about the characters. I also think the movie should have spent a little time on setup about the Fremen. I get that they are oppressed by the Harkonnen, but their sacrifices and lost freedom should be shown to the viewer so we understand the emotional motivation to do a full assault on the Harkonnen. Austin Butler was so intense in the movie. It illustrates his acting range. I hope he is recognized for his performance. And here are some little nit-picky criticisms. They don't address how the Fremen eat. In terms of world building, these sort of details are necessary to make the world believable. I'm not convinced humans could survive on Arrakis. There is no way you could grow crops and raise animals. Did they eat synthetic food? The planet also couldn't sustain gigantic worms. These huge beasts would have to consume millions of calories a day, which is not available. Showing the details of a sustainable life on such a dry planet would help with believability. And the voice control thing done by the Bene Gesserit is sort of dumb. I know this is from the book, but that part of the book doesn't hold up over time.~7/10~16 March 2024
ghanima_atrieadies~Good, except for Chani~It's hard to adapt Dune. It's very intricate and with today's snowflakes they have put their own spin on it. Could have been perfect but of course they can't just tell the story as it was written. I'll star with the Pros: Overall, very nicely done. Austin Butler nailed Feyd-Rautha and the fight with he and Paul was great. The black sun on Geidi Prime was very unique and interesting. Paul riding Shai-hulud for the first time was great and the Attack on Arakeen with the worms was great. Pre-born Alia. I liked that they showed Jessica talking to her and that Jessica is one hell of a badasa. Cons: A, number 1, Paul and Chani. Changing her character changed their relationship into something that didn't make sense. The fact that they changed Chani means they didn't understand her. She loved Paul and stood with him throughout the campaign and for as long as she was alive. She was his tether so he didn't lose his humanity while on his path. She wasn't 'blinded by love' she pushed back on him but never left him even when he married Irulan. Timeline, Paul's campaign was less than 9 months as Alia isn't even born yet. He spent somewhere in the ballpark of 5 years in the desert. He and Chani even had a son. Why change that? Changing that means you changed who killed the Baron which is a pretty important thing in Alia's life and comes back later. She is known as Alia of the Knife for a reason. In conclusion, it's a good movie, it really is but even for someone who had never seen or read Dune like my date, Chani was a bipolar pain. "I love you but I don't trust you." "I believe in you but I don't believe you." "You are the written prophecy but I don't believe you." That wishy washy, back and fourth takes you out of the movie because you don't believe this is a real relationship.~8/10~16 March 2024
FKDZ~Dune 2~Dune 2, a step up in almost every way from the first part, the second installment of this series once again exceeds expectations. Now with a bit more of the emotional pull the first movie might've been missing a bit. This is a must watch for any fantasy sci-fi fan. Whilst Dune 1 was for the most part a lot of learning and set up in terms of getting the viewer to understand the world they're in. Dune 2 delves deeper into the society that surrounds it's main planet. And dives deeper into the main characters story and future. It is still heavy on the introductions of new things, and it never seems to stop adding moving parts to expand the world we're in. Dune 2 focuses more on character and the more human elements, whilst still giving plenty of action and lore. It's a mesmerizing spectacle. And that mostly due to the masterful directing. This series is becoming Villeneuve's magnum opus, and it has every right to be. If anything, both movies have been a masterclass in directing, pacing and composition. It borders on every frame a painting territory but doesn't dwell and needing to feel pretty. It's stylized just enough to plant you in a unique world unlike anything else I've seen in a while. It does so at a LOTR/Star Wars level, that's impressive. I've made the comparison to Star Wars with the first movie but we've definitely veered off that feeling, it's becoming it's own thing now and all the better for it. The underlying themes are still present, here being religion and devotion. And allows for some extra reflection which is nice. Acting is once again phenomenal, I already knew the main cast is incredible, and the newly added cast is just as good. That said, the casting. Specifically for the Emperor, I found lacking, neither did the accent fit in the world nor did it feel like a strong enough character to hold that position. It is the only casting I felt that was out of place. Even though I like Walken as a actor, like recently in Severance where he was great. I don't think he works here though. That said it's not present in a significant amount of the movie to really annoy me enough or degrade the experience. The music, again. Incredible, the main theme is just so good and used surprisingly sparingly in full force. I do need to watch both movies again to really refresh myself on this. And yeah, these movies deserve a second viewing. Though the best option is to see it in a nice theater with proper sound. Because then it becomes a ride you don't want to ever end. It took me a few minutes to get back into it, but halfway through I just wanted it to last forever. Being said, as much as Dune 1 felt like a big set-up, Dune 2 follows the same thread, but feels more coherent as a singular movie. The risk of all these open ends is the future, and if they can hold this standard of quality. All in all, this is what makes theaters worth visiting again and pay the current day premium for overpriced seats, drinks and popcorn.~9/10~16 March 2024
bqxcfmkj~Overrate Bad Movie~This Movie is a proof that modern cinema is death - overhyped and, in many ways, a bad movie 1. The Story is a glimpse of what the book is telling 2. Acting is so bad or emotionless 3. Colorless to the extent that they use filters in the Desert Scene, so Arakis looks like a death planet 4. The Music is boring and Sounds like a cheap drone sound from a sample lip 5. Paul acts like a dictator, and Chanie is so irrelevant to the whole story 6. Stilgar is shown as an idiot - far, far away from what he is in the books 7. The CGI is so bad that it's a good example of how not to use CGI in a Movie (the battle scenes are so poor) 8. The misunderstanding of religion is breathtaking - the whole movie is a big insult to all Islamic people 9. Villeneuve has no clue about the Dune books in any way. Look to David Lynch or Alejandro Jodorowsky - they have a better understanding 10. All scenes that are copied from David Lynch's approach, like the end scene looking like a poor copy of the original (the endfigth is so ridiculously bad), This whole movie, with Part 1, shows why modern movies are so bad - no emotions, no good world-building, clinical, empty, soulless acting and bad CGI.~1/10~16 March 2024
bdart-44769~It's awaken same emotions as almost 30y ago~The mood. The acting. The industrial look of devil Harkonnen. The crowd slowly starting to follow the leader. The battles scenes showing the sand storm, and everything perfectly combined into one masterpiece. I remember very well what I felt when I read the book passage about Paul giving the speech and eventually turning fremens on his side, the movie brought back the same emotions, gave me goosebumps.. For a Dunephile this was truly amazing experience. I didn't realise that anyone can be able to turn Dune story into such good adaptation, hats down to Denis Villeneuve for making it happen. As Frank Herbert said "Don't trust the leaders to always be right", and the movie reflects how power can become devastating, change you personally same as it is shown in the book.~10/10~16 March 2024
weicherstein~great visuals, but unsatisfying, disappointing, contradictory~I was really looking forward to see this movie. I liked the first one and the old one from 1984. I don't want to say that, but the film is a fart in the wind instead of a thunder. Like Villeneuve's Bladerunner 2049 the optics and style are awesome, However the characters and plot give the impression of depth where is none in the end. The same disappointment when the movie comes to it's conclusion. The fact there might be a part 3 does not change that. What are the big flaws of Dune part two? Paul is shown as humble and only wants to help. He is aware of the dangers of beeing a messiah only to go full megalomania once he drinks the water of life. And the final battle is underwhelming. No real struggle to win, no clever descissions to turn the tide, no new weapons or ships to see. Other characters are even worse. - Yes the emperor is supposed to be weak, but he is so dull that it's impossible to belive he made it to such a high age in this position. - Vladimir Harkonnen was dangerous and terrifying in part one. Now he is shown to be strangely submissive when facing a joke of an emperor and his nephew who might become his successor. That doesn't fit his character at all. - Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen has to fight drugged opponents in the colosseum and a doctor, suddenly he is the big scary final boss? - The Fremen were the good guys where Paul was supposed to grow together with and fight for them to give them a better future. Now it feels like they are nothing more like some native tribe who is manipulated with witchcraft to be a tool of power for the next emperor. There are several other points, but these are the most important reasons why the pretty pictures are not enough to make this film satisfying to watch. Like John Carter of Mars. Nice to see, but so very meh at the end..~7/10~16 March 2024
wittmeier~Different from the first part~The first third to half of the movie was top-notch (10/10), then for 45 minutes "nothing" happened (7.5/10) until the finale at the end (9/10). Compared to the first Dune movie there was more plot, but everything felt smaller. The millions of Fremen felt like 10-50. Even during the coliseum scene and festivities for Feyd-Rautha, only a few actors were shown in each shot. (Except AI generated crowds in the background.) Also the music was less ambient and bombastic than in the first movie. They introduced some foreign elements without need: The Butlerian Jihad was erradicated from the lore - clearly electronic thinking devices are used by the Harkonnens and possibly the Artreides The Northern Fremen are shown as rejecting mysticism and hierarchies and even making fun of - they should have toned this down; that does not fit to Fremen culture, the harsh environment, where they have to survive and also not to, what was shown in the movie before: Even Fremen dying from thirst would not drink from the water. The way Chani and her gang talked, I would not have put it beyond them to go for a midnight swim in the holy waters. The sentence about the Fremen being an egalitarian society between men and women was totally misplaced. In the movie they show the two hierarchies of Fremen, the religious hierarchy of women starting down from the Reverend Mother, and the worldly hierarchy of men (they do not show Stilgar as overall leader). Chani talking about Dukes and her feeling of inferiority was out of character, when she talked about it. Where did she meet Dukes (except Paul)? Where is the pride of Fremen and their distaste of the people living in cities? Especially Chani should think differently ... The Sardaukar were laughable in the battle scenes. The Fremen could have been shown a bit more sneakily superior and more intelligent. They tooks risks, and often were needlessly killed. Gurney Halleck was so bad, he should have better been left out. His only role was to connect Paul back to his destiny as Duke of the Artreides. The sandworms could have been depicted better: Where were the ring segments, which can be individually rotated? Where were the roles of the Fremen with riding of a sandworm normally being a team effort.~9/10~16 March 2024
libingrui-14973~An epic in the 20s~This is what the hollywood really needs in recent years ,not onlt fancy vision effects ,but also a huge ,a splendid story. From my point of view,i think the beginning is too boring-----i had no ideas what it was talking about because it has been almost 3 years since Dune Part One,and honestly,i am kind of dislike a movie filmed in a art way. However, my attitude towards it shifted when the movie went on---in short , which is ,VERY NICE. I think i can't explain my feelings unless you see it .Trust me,it worths. I stick to the belief that decades ago, the DUNEs will be as classic and famous as what STAR WARS and Lords of Rings is like now.~8/10~16 March 2024
thewahed~Good but poor pacing and predictable~The pacing of the movie felt off for both, dune 1 and 2, the flashbacks were too often and they were too similar, there was too much repetition and the sound design did not help, movie feels dated, it's a shame there was no shot of the worm completely/mostly out of sand, the emporer felt a little lackluster, overall I am somewhat disappointed in the movie I had high hopes but the movie did not deliver, the chosen one prophecy portion is also pretty much default no unique aspect drinks and instantly swaps personality, the design and brutality of harkonans although aesthetically intresting made the villains pretty one note, the bene geserett were intresting but that's about it.~6/10~16 March 2024
jawadawan-84542~Blown Away - A Beyond Comparison Masterpiece~I love watching movies though have never left a review but felt compelled to write one for Dune 2 as it had such a profound impact on me. Don't think my words can do justice to what i just experienced but would say that, I went in expecting it to be a great movie but it turned out to be my greatest watch ever. I re-watched the first one before going in. I would recommend doing just that as it would make watching part 2 so much better. Every aspect of the movie was wonderful and the pace with which the movie progressed was just right. I would strongly recommend this movie, what an experience.~10/10~16 March 2024
jboothmillard~Dune: Part Two~The first film was a great success, one of the highest-grossing movies of 2021 and receiving numerous accolades, the sequel was delayed by the Hollywood strikes, but I hoped it was worth the wait, based on the book by Frank Herbert, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049). Basically, in the distant future, Princess Irulan Corrino (Florence Pugh) secretly records in her journal that Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) may still be alive, while her father, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), is disheartened after the fall of House Atreides. On the barren desert planet of Arrakis, the Fremen troops of tribe leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem), along with Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), prevail over an attack from a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others believe a prophecy that a mother and son from the "Outer World" will bring prosperity to Arrakis. Stilgar tells Jessica that Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) is dying and she must become her replacement by drinking the Water of Life, which is poisonous to males and the untrained. Jessica transmutes after drinking the fatal liquid, surviving and inheriting the memories of every female ancestor in her lineage. Jessica is pregnant with a child, and the liquid prematurely awakens the mind of the unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus on trying to convince the northern Fremen who are more sceptical of the prophecy. Young rebellious warrior Chani (Zendaya) and her friend Shishakli (Souheila Yacoub) believe the prophecy is a fabricated narrative made to manipulate the Fremen. When Paul delivers a speech to the Fremen people about not seeking power and only wanting to fight alongside them, Chani develops respect for him. Paul embraces the Fremen ways, learning their language, the dangerous act of riding sandworms, becoming a Fedaykin fighter and helping raid Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names "Usul" and "Muad'Dib", and he and Chani fall in love. Due to the devastating spice raids, House patriarch Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) replaces his brutish nephew Rabban aka "Beast" (Dave Bautista) as Arrakis' ruler with his psychotic, murderous younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Elvis's Austin Butler). Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux), a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd's suitability as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and to seduce him to secure his genes. Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe in the prophecy. Paul has disturbing visions of a holy war that will occur if he goes south where he is believed to be a messiah. Paul stays north and reunites with Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) who leads him to an atomic stockpile hidden by House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha attacks Sietch Tabr and kills Shishakli, forcing Paul and the surviving Fremen to journey south. After arriving, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. Chani, angered by his actions, helps to wake him up by mixing her tears with the liquid. Paul gains a clearer vision of the past and future, seeing an adult Alia on a future Arrakis with a supply of water. He also discovers that his mother is the Baron's daughter, making him both Atreides and Harkonnen. The southern Fremen leaders urge Paul to challenge Stilgar for leadership. But he refuses and instead spurs the fundamentalists by showing that he can read their innermost thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Emperor Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan, the Reverend Mother, and his Sardaukar troops. The Fremen launch a massive military strike against the emperor's forces using atomics and sandworms. They overpower the Sardaukar, while Paul kills the Baron and takes Shaddam and his entourage captive. Gurney intercepts Rabban trying to flee and kills him. Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne, demanding Irulan's hand in marriage. The Great Houses, who were summoned by the Baron, arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomics if they interfere. Shaddam chooses Feyd-Rautha as his champion, he and Paul have a knife duel, which ends with Paul hilling his opponent. Irulan agrees to marry Paul on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam kneels and kisses Paul's signet ring. The Great Houses above Arrakis reject Paul's ascendancy, so Paul orders the Fremen to attack the fleet in orbit. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia see this as the beginning of Muad'Dib's holy war. Chani refuses to bow to Paul and departs alone on a sandworm. Also starring Roger Yuan as Lanville, Babs Olusanmokun as Jamis, Alison Halstead as Maker Keeper, Giusi Merli as Reverend Mother Ramallo, Imola Gáspár as Watermaster, and Anya Taylor-Joy as Alia Atreides. I'm not going to pretend I understood everything going on, with all the stuff involving religion and politics, just the main plot that everyone wants the spice. Chalamet goes from a young steady hero to braver leading figure, Zendaya gets more screen time as his love interest, Skarsgård being nasty and grotesque and Bautista being aggressive and loud are equally good as the villains, and the all-star cast, including Brolin, Bardem, Rampling, and Walken all get their moments as well. The visuals and special effects remain fantastic, from the spaceships and alien creatures to the interior and exterior locations and large-scale battle scenes, so it doesn't matter if you don't understand it all, it is a great spectacle, and hopefully the third and presumably concluding part will be as exciting, a worthwhile epic science-fiction adventure. Very good!~7/10~16 March 2024
nlivastri~Best movie i have EVER watched~This movie is so beautiful. The cinematography is INSANE. Seeing Denis bring his dream to life is so cool! And the cast is GORGEOUS and so extremly talented!!! And especially Timothée's performance. The way you see him grow from being a boy in Dune part 1 to him becoming a man in Dune part 2 is just so beautiful and cool! And also Paul's character development during this movie is so inspiring! You see how he grows more confident. After i saw Dune part 2 it has not left my mind. I love watching interwiews with the cast and the AMAZING outfits from the press tour! And i'm so so SO EXITED for the third film!!~10/10~16 March 2024
stevegriffin-93522~Slow, boring and disjointed~I became suspicious that this was a poor movie after about 10 minutes. After 30 minutes I knew I was right - this film was really slow and tedious. I gritted my teeth and decided I'd try to stay awake to see the film to the end so I could write this review warning others not to waste 2-3 hours of their life watching it. I noticed several people give up and leave the film part-through - I should have joined them in retrospect. Main characters not very convincing in their roles, patchy story making it difficult to piece together, noisy at times, using unnecessary music to try (and fail) to create drama.~1/10~16 March 2024
ac1dm0nk~Absolute Masterpiece!~Dennis Villeneuve is a true visionary for being able to project the book into this stunningly visual masterpiece that his peers have failed to do so. From stunt choreography to costumes, Villeneuve has done an excellent job at creating an entirely new world with its very own people and culture exactly as Frank Herbert intended it to be. This movie is a tribute to the novel for those who've read it. Nobody else has come this close to projecting it so perfectly and I don't think anyone else will in the near future. Those who feel confused about the story probably never read the novel or watched the first part because Villeneuve has made sure to add every detail necessary for the progression of its story. I've already watched it twice and planning to run it back once again and I can't emphasize how many new details I keep discovering on the way. This movie is an absolute masterpiece compared to all the garbage thats been getting dumped into Hollywood lately.~10/10~16 March 2024
abs7110~Part one was promising, this second part disappointed me~My opinion on Dune part 2? Not bad, but not so good. I see an inconclusive meatloaf, full of religious extremism, lacking in philosophy and poetry. I have noticed a lack of explanations and details of the story, and no real introduction to the wonderful world in which the story takes place. Visually nothing to complain about, but the story seems weak to me, not very deep and not at all clear in many aspects. The actors emerge, but it wasn't enough for me to leave the cinema satisfied. The first part of Dune was barely promising, it hinted a potential, unfortunately not fully realized in this second part.~5/10~16 March 2024
Dvir971~The Sci-Fi/Fantasy Epic of our Generation~Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away. As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well. Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does. In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters. The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon. I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again. Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre. Extremely recommended.~10/10~26 February 2024
Orr971~The perfect sequel. Enchanting.~Denis Villeneuve obviously takes Dune very seriously. As it peaks up right where Part One left off, we remain with 1.5 acts that's left of what I refer to as the Dune Duo. A Part 3 is of course necessary but until we get one, it's a duo. And then it fits perfectly: Part One is 1.5 acts of the story and we're left with a dazzling display of intensity. Hans Zimmer continues what he many times referred to as a project that is really close to him, and it shows. After releasing additional 2 albums full of almost 4 hours of music besides the official Dune Part One soundtrack, he continues his quest for the true soul of Dune (in my opinion) - the music. Which leads me to my next point: you HAVE TO watch it in IMAX. It will blow you away. My popcorn box was literally vibrated by the bass, and some parts of the film were so visually stunning that I was quite literally jaw dropped. Without giving anything away, Dune Part 2 is just magnificent.~10/10~26 February 2024
Ellimof~WOW! I need Dune Messiah now.~If you liked or loved the first one, the same will apply for this one. Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer. For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally. I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress. I guess that's pretty much every category now that I've typed it out lol.~10/10~26 February 2024
nickventura-98896~Incredible Film~Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey, and I was completely blown away. From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored, which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film. I don't want to write too much here, I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately. It doesn't release worldwide until March 1st, so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible. Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras. This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar's for sound editing, picture, etc., and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically. Like I stated in the beginning, see this film!~9/10~26 February 2024
eotbruh~Star Wars of the 2020's~I had the joy of watching this movie early, and was nothing short of amazed. Simply put this movie is one of the best crafted, and most impressive films I have ever seen. The casting is spectacular, and the massive character arcs that are displayed masterfully are as well. The camera angles are creative and unique, showcasing multiple landscapes in fascinating new ways (even surpassing the quality of Dune part One). This movie gave me the chills often and was reminiscent of the original three Star Wars movies in a way. Both franchises paved the way for something entirely new, and showcase revolutionary film techniques that are sure to dazzle and inspire audiences for years to come. This movie was one of the best I have ever seen and I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to sit through a three hour long movie.~10/10~26 February 2024
Eb04~Absolutely stunning~I just watched this in IMAX and it was one of the greatest movie experiences I have ever had. Everything from part one was done even better in part two and the story was much more interesting. The outfits were so unique and really well made. Whenever I thought it was starting to move a little slow something insane happens and I'm instantly drawn back into the world of dune that Denis has remade and expanded on so much. All the shots of the different worlds were just breathtaking. The last hour of the movie is by far some of the best made cinema in awhile and the action was so good. The last fight was awesome as well. "You fought well Atreides."~9/10~26 February 2024
reelfilmophile~Masterclass in grand spectacle~I have said that Denis Villeneuve is a master of putting grand spectacle on screen. Dune: Part 2 was an outsized enhancement of its predecessor. Seeing it in IMAX helped bring the massive landscape of this film into scope for the viewer. Greig Fraser is a master cinematographer. The camera work, coupled with the special effects, have created a world that evokes a visceral feeling of realism. The stunning visuals were accompanied with a beautiful score to guide emotions and tactful sound design that was vociferous in nature but also withdrawn when it needed to be. Believable choreography & acting to boot. A star-studded cast that never outshines their characters - only once I kind of got taken out of the movie by a character and it was because of weird line delivery. The story was drawn out but never felt like it was dragging. A fantastic experience with a crowd & another cinematic achievement to add to Denis' filmography that will surely bring him more awards. P.s. Javier Bardem was having a TIME with his role & Austin Butler showed off his range as an actor. Also, loved the surprise cameo from an actress who is starring in another big movie this year! P.s.s. Can I make "ride the worm" a commonly used phrase without it being misconstrued as dirty? This is a clear early 2025 Oscar candidate for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Design, Best Editing, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Score. ...potential in acting categories as well...~10/10~26 February 2024
michellexinma~Truly a masterpiece~After watching the advanced screening, we were blown away by Part 2 of Dune. It continues seamlessly after Part 1, with the same masterful soundtracks, action scenes and acting. The movie flew by despite it being almost three hours. The pacing was incredibly well done and nothing felt too fast or too slow. The CGI was incredibly realistic and the characters were portrayed so well by the lead actors. The chemistry between the characters felt so real - nothing felt fake or forced. It's truly difficult finding a movie that contains everything - flawless screenplay, writing, sound, acting and pacing, but Dune 2 does it all. One of the best movies of 2024 for sure.~10/10~26 February 2024
loganmerrill~It's an experience~Just got out of the early access screening, and all I can say is wow. Truly blew my mind, from start to finish, the film keeps the foot on the gas peddle and doesn't allow you to breath even for a second. The arena has got to be one of my favourite scenes in any movie, the cinematography, colour, score and performance by Butler is truly a sight to behold. Outstanding performances by Timothe and Butler, with Timothe showing his range throughout the course of the movie, morphing into the thing he tries to avoid the most, and Butler playing the psychopath amazingly well. One you want to see in IMAX, memorable experience.~10/10~26 February 2024
guslopes-75373~Denis Villeneuve Promises and Delivers~This movie more than accomplished all of the promises it set out, absolutely mesmerizing experience. I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timothée Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts. Overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didn't even enjoy the first installment of the series.~10/10~26 February 2024
awessel-58117~A masterpiece, a pillar of sci-fi/fantasy~This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having. This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene. This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. 10/10.~10/10~26 February 2024
davideminorjr~Heavy Spoilers for book readers:~It was a packed house for the February 25 fan premiere and the film did not disappoint. Since the first film, several like myself have read the books and now we're going to compare --- because that's what happens when an IP gets famous, i.e. Most of us didn't compare GOT season 1 to ASOIAF when we first watched it. Alia is not in the film. At all, except as a fetus who speaks to Jessica. So of course she doesn't kill the Baron. It actually works out. From a filmmaking point, good luck finding a child who could do justice to the role, even if you age her up. Jessica, in my opinion, becomes the villain after drinking the water of life. She essentially manipulates Paul into become the Mahdi. It was previously ambiguous as to her birthing a son, and by extension the Kwizatch Haderach, was due to love or vanity. This would almost now appear to be the latter. Again, just my opinion, but I don't believe the water changed her, more likely it awakened a dormant ambition. Chani is by far the most improved character from the books. With all respect to Frank Herbert, she didn't really do much. She was the love interest and ultimately the mother of the Tyrant and that pretty much sums up her relevance in the Dune Saga. She is still all that of course, but while she loves Paul, she's an outspoken cynic concerning him being a Messiah. This was a welcome change. Stilgar is exactly what he was at the end of the first book but all that throughout. I am mildly disappointed. Nevertheless, he is the most comedic character. Paul kills the Baron. Chani breaks up with him (kinda). The door is wide open for part 3. Those are the most significant changes from the book. I would encourage anyone to watch it and not allow these to detract from your enjoyment. Everyone did a great job on the film as a whole and of course it's a 10!~10/10~26 February 2024
tcbvxyxc~movie of the year, undoubtedly~Visually stunning, gripping acting, and an insane story this movie was actually so good i cried 3 times at some of the beautiful shots. SPOILERS AHEAD the worm riding scene... was absolutely crazy and so memorable, making me already want to rewatch just an hour after leaving the theater. Austin butlers performance was brilliant and the fight between him and paul... just so good. This may just become one of the top trilogies of all time, competing with the likes of the lord of the rings and the original star wars films. Only time will tell but for now i am in awe with how much better it was than the first.~10/10~26 February 2024
christianreedbrown-65145~The Dark Knight and Empire Strikes Back of our generation...~I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible. See for yourself in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts. Overall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema.~10/10~26 February 2024
FeastMode~Another entry that doesn't entirely stand on its own~Dune: Part Two is on par with the first in nearly every aspect. However you felt about the first one is likely how you will feel about this sequel. It's a visual and auditory explosion of beauty and the technical aspects are all pristine. Directing, cinematography and music are elite. And they continue to build the cast with great new additions. But just like with Part One, the lack of story progression is noticeable. We don't get the ups and downs of a three-act structure. It feels like one act stretched out to 165 minutes. Again we don't seem to really have a climax. I didn't feel the emotional resonance or investment in the story and characters. And I didn't entirely grasp character motivations, like why a character does something or why another is upset about it. With Part One, I was a lot more forgiving of it not being able to completely stand on its own. But now it's getting a little frustrating. Also, the PG-13 limitations are glaring. (1 viewing, early fan screening IMAX 2/25/2024)~6/10~26 February 2024
akshajk8~Absolutely Stunning Cinematic Experience~Just got out of an early screening in IMAX 70mm and it was amazing. The visuals and CGI in this film were excellent and it was cinematographically better than Dune Part 1 even. A lot happens in this movie story-wise and the pacing was very good. Denis Villeneuve uses beautiful filmmaking techniques and the end result is just stunning. The contrast between one black and white scene and the rest of the movie being colored was a brilliant move and really leaves the audience's mouth hanging and hair standing up in suspense. There are many twists/surprises in the story and they are all executed flawlessly. I never felt bored in this movie. The action scenes and the sword/knife fighting scenes were also very well choreographed and it was definitely refreshing to see. This movie was much better than Dune Part 1 in terms of story, cinematography, CGI, and everything else, and this movie definitely sets up Dune 3 in a perfect way. Overall, the movie was fantastic, a must-watch, and I HIGHLY recommend watching it in IMAX.~10/10~26 February 2024
AfricanBro~Long live the fighters~Phenomenal stuff. I'll probably calm down tomorrow but right now my heart's beating like crazy and my brain's screaming it's a bloody masterpiece. This is one of the few movies that I didn't try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways. "Power over spice is power over all"- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It's a cinematic experience; I can't imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere. When Part One came out people said it was "game of thrones in space", I wasn't really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV's Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all. However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One's focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can't spell their names lol), and the Baron's family. Despite the emperor's pulling the strings, the Baron's family still felt like main antagonist to me. The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn't tell, I was absolutely immersed in it. I absolutely loved the kind "The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi." Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn't expecting any humour. It's funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I'd already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn't spoil a thing. The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul's changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me. Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn't really get as much screen time as you'd think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team's suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn't wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times. Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon. One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he's depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different. Loved Austin butler though, I wasn't sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting 'the water of life' had some insane calves on her, I'm extremely jealous. While I was initially not convinced about Timothée Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I'd not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie's end. Zendaya's portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character. We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the "water of life" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me. I think watching this movie at home won't do it justice, it's clearly made for the big screens if you can. It's pretty epic and I think it'll remain memorable as one of 2024's best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it.~9/10~26 February 2024
greenml~A Masterclass in Science Fiction.~It seems that many movies have become increasingly longer and longer and we groan and bemoan this fact. But Dune Part II left me wanting more. I would love to see an extended edition of this film. It is a film that is visually and sonically stunning. Go and see it on the biggest screen as possible. Fans of the book may find elements of this adaptation frustrating as it does take a few major deviations from the book. Yet the film captures the very essence of the novel and brings to life the wild fanaticism of the Fremon people, whose long awaited messiah emerges. This is among some of the most compelling and invigorating storytelling ever brought to life on the big screen. Does it surpass Dune Part One? Yes. What about Star Wars or Empire Strikes Back. I don't think so but let me go and watch it again and again before I make such an assessment. I am already considering a second and third viewing of this movie. Maybe even a fourth. Go and Watch this movie. It is mesmerizing.~9/10~26 February 2024
johnnymay-36676~Perfect theatrical sequeal~When I first watched Dune two years ago I couldn't get enough of the story or the surrounding lore. I read the first book soon after as to immerse myself in knowing what would happen next and to have a better knowledge of the universe. At the time in my mind the first part missed out on some things that I felt were important in establishing the overall story, however after watching the second part I understand what Denis Villeneuve's vision cinematically needed to go a slightly different direction. The battles in the second part were epic and all of the added stuff of Paul training was a fun experience. I'm sad to see the whole story arc of Thufir Hawat as well as Paul's child and his bizarre sister being dropped, but I understand that when it comes to adapting a novel to the big screen that some things aren't as necessary/needed to build for future installments. I loved this movie, it was such a great sequel and is helping further the vision of Frank Herbert.~10/10~26 February 2024
her5066~This is what Hollywood needs!~This is what Hollywood needs. A great story with a great director/producer. After that the best thing a studio can do is get the hell out of the way and let artists create art. Dune Part 2 is creative, beautiful, tragic, and mesmerizing. Never once did I get bored or anticipate what was going to happen next. I haven't read the book so I have nothing to compare it to. Denis Villeneuve continues to amaze me with the effort he puts into each of his films. The acting in this film was top notch too. We saw it in IMAX and the sound was earth shattering. If you're gonna see this movie, see it on the largest screen possible.~10/10~26 February 2024
reaganreviews~I might buy the Dune popcorn bucket...~Austin Butler sheds his Elvis accent while Timothee Chalamet continues to sharpen his jawline as the Fremen's messiah. Dune: Part Two is an absolute sci-fi masterpiece. Director Denis Villeneuve expertly builds upon the solid foundation laid by the first film injecting politics, religion, and romance. The acting here is fantastic with standouts being Austin Butler, who is psychotic and creepy as Feyd-Rautha, along with Rebecca Ferguson, who takes on something totally different than the last film's characterization of Lady Jessica. Greig Fraser is also a standout as the cinematographer along with the entire vfx team. This group is incredibly talented, using a very limited color palette to create stunningly realistic sandworms, spaceships, and otherworldly armies. The sound mixing department and Hans Zimmer's score also work hand in hand to create an oddly pleasing yet deafening IMAX theater experience. This film is so loud and grand. I also respect how Denis Villeneuve is sticking to his guns that he had while filming Sicario: he doesn't want to glorify the violence as he wants to show its effects on its victims. While the film is visually stunning, the violence is what it is. It's brutal and not over the top. Overall, Dune showcases the best sci-fi has to offer with a great adaptation of Frank Herbert's space drama created with top tier acting and production.~9/10~26 February 2024
walkerschindler~INSANELY GOOD!!~Incredibly grateful to have seen this as it was released! Feels like I got to see Star Wars or Lord of the Rings on opening night!! Absolutely stunning! I read the books and fell in love! After the first movie I was so happy that Denis Villeneuve did the book justice and prayed that the second would live up to it. It exceeded it by far. I genuinely have no complaints. Despite knowing what was going to happen from reading the books I was on the edge of my seat still questioning the outcome of fight scenes. The casting was spot on, the music was incredible, the visuals were insane, and the cinematography was legendary. I can't wait to see more in the next film.~10/10~26 February 2024
s-15230~Great production but don't expect anything deeper~(8/10) Watching it on an IMAX screen is definitely the best way to enjoy the film. It shows the best CG and production level of Hollywood. The battle scenes are generally quite ceremonial and impressive. The storytelling is smooth. However, the whole setting of shield defense in part 1 is completely abandoned. I haven't finished the novel, but I heard it's a quite in-depth one. In Part 2 of Dune, there are not many deep implications regarding either colonization or environment, even family relationships. There is only Paul's unavoidable fate to become a ruthless tyrant. @ Cineplex Riverport IMAX.~8/10~26 February 2024
Kirpianuscus~good job~Too easy to define it as impressive. For SFX, for acting, for fair and huge effort to adaptate a masterpiece. It is just a cathedral. It is memorable at whole defining the hard effort of a so ambitious director . But, I recognized, I am not one of its fans , not animated by enthusiasm, without ignore than I like it . A film proposing many gifts , great scene by scene, having the virtue to explore in pasionned manner the novel. Two good points for me - the white - gray of Harkonnen - indeed, not exactly the Harkonnen imagined by Herbert and the nice option for Emperor . I was seduced at whole by the work of Javier Bardem and I keep same question after the first part - is Timothee Chalamet the best option for Paul Atreides ? I do not know. It is not my favorit adaptation ( old and conservative, I remains prisoner of more modest Tv series of 2000 but I applaused and I appreciated this second delightful, imperial second part.~10/10~16 March 2024
Sleepin_Dragon~A movie of epic proportions, everything I'd hoped for.~Paul has to prove himself to both Chani and The Fremen, his dreams become more vivid, one path leads to destruction, maybe even the loss of Chani. I don't think I've anticipated a film quite so much as this, since being spellbound by the first, I counted down the days for this follow up, and by chance got to see it a day early. In one single word, captivating, the best film I've seen in a very long time, absolutely wonderful from start to finish, the character development, visuals, music, action sequences are all tremendous. We get to see Paul growing before our very eyes, the character at the end of the film is very different to the one at the start, the best yet from Chalamet, he shows a degree of grit. A special mention about the performance of Austin Butler, I thought he was incredibly good as Feyd Rauth, what a menacing villain, one of those that had you wondering about what he'd do next, and that makeup, awesome. I can't fault a single performance, inspired casting, backed up by a marvellous script. The music is spot on once again, I instantly wanted to download Ripples in The sand and Paul's Dream once again. Incredible visuals, from the amazing location work, to the creative camera work, and the jaw dropping special effects. I thought this was going to be the toughest movie of the franchise, as so much happens at the start and the finish, it wasn't the case, this was a fabulous movie. 10/10.~10/10~29 February 2024
kosmasp~Still Dune fine~No pun intended - you may have seen the meme with Joey (of Friends fame), who is asking: How you dune? Well anyone who knows the show/series, knows what is up. Visually stunning and story wise, just amazing. Of course at certain moments it may remind one of Life of Brian and generally speaking of satire. There is also a cringe moment of love - it's almost too sweet what is happening between two main characters. But the scope is bigger here - the audio is bigger, the sets are bigger ... the worms are bigger too. I have not read the books, but I think Denis does a great job for brining us close to that ... well as clise as possible of course. If you have not seen it on a big screen yet .. do as long as it is possible. Yes it is almost 3 hours long ... but you won't feel that. You won't have those moments you have from other movies, where you'll be looking at your watch/phone. This gives us a promise of a third one ... which I assume will cover more of the books. And I will be watching in cimemas too (Imax). Every department works hand in hand and was able to achieve a great movie. Hans Zimmer back for more epic scoring ... let chaos reign I say.~8/10~7 March 2024
nogodnomasters~Show me who you are~The series is not over. Part two leaves open a part three. The real problem is the length of time between the releases. I forgot most of the first feature. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) lives among the locals as he learns to become one of them including the John Cleese silly walk one must do to walk across the worm-infested desert. Mom aka Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson) becomes the great holy mother and is with child. We discover a twist in her genealogy when Paul has a vision. Worlds collide as Paul becomes smitten with Chani Spice (Zendaya). Chani is our skeptic. She believes that prophecy and the promise of a coming messiah are tools used to enslave people. Dave Bautista remains typecast as a brute. Christopher Walken is still alive but I suggest they film his parts first in the next feature. They could have cut 30 minutes from the feature if they eliminated all of Timothée Chalamet's slow swagger walks. It got silly after a while. Guide: No swearing or nudity. Implied sex.~7/10~11 March 2024
kevin_robbins~Dune Part Two is a remarkable addition to the science fiction genre and a must-see epic~My wife and I attended a screening of Dune II (2024) last night. The storyline follows Paul as he establishes himself among the Fremen, torn between being seen as a messiah and viewing himself as an ordinary man seeking revenge. His budding relationship with Chani adds complexity, as he grapples with love versus the expectations of becoming a Messiah. Meanwhile, the success in repelling world invaders attracts a formidable opponent poised to stop them and annihilate the Fremen. Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049), the film stars Timothée Chalamet (Wonka), Zendaya (Euphoria), Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men), Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men), Austin Butler (Elvis), Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter), David Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy), and Florence Pugh (Black Widow). Dune Part Two is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography excels with brilliant use of lighting, attire, camera angles, and settings, crafting an atmospheric and expansive experience. Exceptional makeup and costumes contribute to a mysterious and authentic feel throughout. The characters are unpredictable, exuding grit and determination. The mother's role is outstanding, and the conversations with the sister are mind-blowing. The inclusion of the worms seamlessly fits into the underlying and overarching storyline. The film immerses you in its universe and slowly builds anticipation for the epic battle. The action, when it unfolds, is brutal, intense, and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. My only critique is that the film could have been better edited for length. In conclusion, Dune Part Two is a remarkable addition to the science fiction genre and a must-see epic. I would rate it 9/10 and highly recommend.~7/10~3 March 2024
CinemaSerf~Dune: Part Two~This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with "Paul" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the "Fremen" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader "Stilgar" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give "Jessica" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on "Chani" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil "Baron Harkonnen" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew "Feyd-Rautha" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on "Arrakis" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of "Khartoum" (1966) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) with a bit of the "Phantom Menace" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!!~7/10~2 March 2024
neil-476~Not as good as part one.~Paul Atreides and his mother are now living with the Fremen following the Harkkonen bid to wipe out clan Atreides. Paul comes to prominence because it seems he may fulfil a prophecy, which may enable him to obtain revenge against the Harkkonens and also the Emperor, who facilitated their action in the first place. But Paul has visions of a war he wants to avoid, and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood have plans of their own. Part Two picks up where the first film left off, and brings the story to a conclusion of sorts (author Frank Herbert wrote five sequels). I was a huge science fiction reader when the original novel was published, but I had a great deal of trouble with it. Its texture and density was a bit too much for me in my mid-teens, and previous film versions didn't help much. I was pleased with Villeneuve's film from 2021, because I could finally follow the story without confusion. Part Two - not so much. The narrative is fairly straightforward, but it often felt as if exposition had been omitted. For instance, Lea Seydoux appears in some tight closeups and meaningful dialogue: she plays Lady Margot Fenring. Who? This is presented as a character of significance, a name actress with image and dialogue delivered using film grammar which shouts Significant! Yet we don't know who she is or why she matters, and we never hear from her again. The performances are good, the visuals are great, but again the story proves difficult to convey without confusion. It's a good film, but it's something of a disappointment compared to its predecessor,~8/10~2 March 2024
Pjtaylor-96-138044~The spice of life.~'Dune: Part Two (2024)' is the continuation of Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal sci-fi novel, beginning almost exactly where 'Dune (2021)' ends. It follows Paul Atreides as he integrates with the Fremen and attempts to learn their ways in order to help them overthrow the brutal Harkonnen regime now controlling Arakkis and just maybe get some good old-fashioned revenge in the process. For me, this represents a major step up from the previous part. It's significantly better than its predecessor in pretty much every way, with a thematically intriguing story that actually justifies an almost three-hour runtime and some of the most impressively tactile visuals I've ever seen (there isn't a single second where you think "that's a good effect", not because the effects aren't phenomenal but because they're so seamlessly integrated with the set and costume design that they feel just as real as the actors themselves). Its world is holistic and utterly immersive, captured with stunning cinematography and soul-shaking sound design, and its narrative actually engages you on an emotional level (something I felt was almost entirely lacking from the first film). It's actually really tragic overall, and it's pretty unconventional in terms of blockbuster storytelling. Furthermore, a lot of its weight is conveyed without the need for dialogue, with the performers often speaking volumes without ever opening their mouths. The cast all do an excellent job, but for me it's perhaps Zendaya who stands out the most. I do need to mention Austin Butler, Javier Bardem, Stellan Skarsgård, Josh Brolin and, of course, Wonka himself Timothée Chalamet as other notable actors in a movie comprised pretty much solely of top-tier talent working at the top of their game. That's a good way to describe the entire picture really: it's the product of a crew comprised entirely of people working at the very top of their game. It really is an incredible experience. The stakes are genuine, the set-pieces are exciting (and suspenseful), the score is colossal, the effects are impeccable, the cinematography is gorgeous, the sound design is otherworldly, the acting is flawless, the editing is effortlessly effective and the overall direction is nothing short of masterful. It's a really enjoyable epic that feels immense in every sense of the word. I also think it works as a semi-standalone movie, although it's obviously intrinsically tied to its predecessor, and I can see myself coming back to it without needing to revisit the first part. It's great. See it on as big a screen as possible.~6/10~14 March 2024
JohnDeSando~Epic novel--epic adaptation~Since the first part of Dune (2021), Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson-about as tough a lady as ever depicted besides Lady Macbeth) join the native tribe of Fremen on sandy planet Arrakis after being clobbered by the family of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). We know more than ambition is involved, viz., spice, a mind-opening drug and fuel (damn good stuff, I'd guess). The Freman leader, Stilgar (Javier Bardem-always room for more of his talent), believes Paul is their Messiah to defeat the Harkonnen and their eventual new leader, Feyed (Austin Butler, sans hair and guitar but with a very bald head and bloody cudgel). Paul readily assimilates with Fremen and totally assimilates with Freman Chani (Zendaya), Paul may be an outsider, but then so was Christ, except that Paul (and Biblical Paul) is reluctant and Christ not so much. With romance developing between Paul and Chani, the allusion to Christ steps aside except for those who think there's more to the Jesus and Mary Magdalene friendship. Anyway, it's classic salvation by an outsider ( consider, if you will, the US and Vietnam). The special effects are what makes this epic film about as beautiful as any you will ever see, which includes riding monstrous worms and a tank bigger and more nimble than any you have ever seen. While the landscape has an inherent greyness much of the time, director Dennis Villeneuve invites comparison to David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia from the blistering landscapes to the blue eyes. Even the worm's magic elixir is arrestingly blue. The conflicting interests go beyond Arrakis as Emperor Shaddam IV (underused Christopher Walken) and his hip daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), involve themselves in the dynamic and dangerous political scene. As for the Spice, the Harkonnen clan have already begun renewing production while Fremen want the opposite- a hot mess. The visual splendor and intricate politics return in yet a third epical rendering, Dune: Messiah. I, for one, can easily last another three hours.~7/10~5 March 2024
imseeg~Dont believe the hype, but dont believe the hate either...~I didnt read the book. I dont care about the book. This is a MOVIE, so forget about comparing the book to the movie and vice versa. Please! I didnt like Part One. It bored the heck out of me. It honestly did. I DO LIKE Part Two much better though, it's vibe is completely different (much more bleak and exciting). But it also has got it's flaws and BEWARE, you wont leave the cinema feeling all cheery and revived, because this sequel is quite a heavy mother... The bad: there is a limit to how long I can stand these contineous Hans Zimmer droning booming sounds. They just do not stop. There needs to be some BALANCE in the use of these bombastic sounds. A pause, a silence now and then only enhances the effect. Less is more... More bad: this movie's storyline is all over the place. It feels rushed at moments, confusing at other moments, some characters randomly appear and disappear. Everybody is (rightfully) complaining about this sequel being low on storyline. The good: Part Two has got a mean, vicious bleak spirit, with some really creapy bad guys. They really succeeded in making me being appalled by some of these mean characters. Great! More good: the action is quite dark and intrusive and mesmirising to watch. Almost hypnotizing action visuals. The really good stuff: the actors are simply sublime. They just dont come any better, although I personally do NOT like that they choose Timothee Chalamet for this character. I think he is just not suited for this role. But that is just my personal opinion... Visually it is terrific (as always with director Denis Villeneuve). Storywise it is kinda disappointing. Mixed bag. Certainly NOT worthy of 9 stars, that's simply ridiculous, but still worth a really enjoyable (heavy mother of a) watch nonetheless. Thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!~7/10~29 February 2024
UniqueParticle~My 2,200 review on here!~Holy cow such an exceptional IMAX experience that deserves praise/awards! Wild how the bulk is exhilarating action with exciting music, all of which is so well done even with the brutal length which I had to push through I'm not the type to go to the bathroom during a movie I don't understand ones that get up a lot especially with Dune it is an absolute pleasure to experience. Such a top notch ride it's quite Impressive how well done everything was and masterful crew behind everything Denis Villenvue is genuinely one of best directors in the industry! Would be nice if my reviews get appreciated more! Dune Part 2 is a phenomenal experience, crazy how much action was packed into the 2 hour 49 minute length all worth it.~8/10~7 March 2024
SAMTHEBESTEST~Denis Villeneuve's Sci-Fi Epic Is Gigantic, Incredible & A Modern Cinematic Achievement~Dune 2 (2024) : Movie Review - Dune 2 Review : First of all, let's hail the great Denis Villeneuve for getting one of the greatest casting coups on board for Dune 2 with Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux, Stellan Skarsgård, Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem. Secondly, let's hail the genius filmmaker for his extraordinary vision that he has kept hidden for years. He was so busy with story-driven films, so we all thought that he couldn't make a big-screen spectacle like Cameron or Jackson. Dune 2 proves that he has enough fire to light the big screen with his astonishing direction skills and visionary storytelling. Dune 2 surpasses the grandeur of Dune Part 1, or, for that matter, any Hollywood movie in recent times, except Avatar: The Way Water. The said Pandora's Blue Tale lacked a unique story, but Denis got it here for his dusty desert tale. So it's like it's a visual spectacle meeting a tremendously rich script. You can't afford to miss that, can you? Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is accepted in the Fremen tribe and is trying to be one of them. While he is getting better during the trailer, Stilgar (Javier Bardem) informs Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) that their Reverend Mother is dying, convincing her to become a replacement by drinking the Water of Life, a deadly poison that is fatal to males and the untrained. She drinks it and turns herself into a mother Reverend, but because she is pregnant, it might turn ill on her. She starts speaking to her unborn child, a daughter, who keeps guiding her on what to do next. Meanwhile, Paul embraces the Fremen ways and learns their language, passing tests like riding a sandworm. He begins a romantic relationship with Chani, becomes a Fedaykin fighter, and assists during raids on Harkonnen spice harvesters, earning the mantles "Muad'Dib" and "Usul," by which the Fremen identify him as the "man who leads the path." On the other hand, Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) demotes Rabbani (Bautista) for humiliating the family by running away from the fight and makes psychotic Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) a new leader. Paul Muad'Dib leads the troop to the south and is joined by the former military leader of Atreides, Gurney (Josh Brolin). Will Paul be able to defeat Baron and Feyd-Rautha? Dune 2 is an engrossing script that lasts for 160 minutes without becoming dull. Yes, there are a few moments that feel slow, but nothing too serious. The conversations are engaging, and some comedy scenes also work despite repetitive lines. Dune 2 scores high in visual presentation. It's an alien world with human-like characters, but it's completely out of your imagination. That's the power of the sci-fi epic genre, right? You must create a world that hasn't been seen or imagined by others. Only then can you convince viewers to believe in your vision and fantasy world. Every single feature of Dune 2 is a prime example of a creative sci-fi world. You get to see new kinds of clothes, people, soldiers, weapons, gods, spiritual idols, wars, and what not. The desert, storm, attacks, machines, flying machines, and what not-how on earth did Denis visualise all these alien things? And the bigger question is, how did he bring them alive on screen without any compromise? That's the most stunning part of Dune 2, and that's more than enough reason why you should not miss this larger-than-life spectacle on the big screen. Dune 2 has a solid acting unit. Timothée Chalamet may have just gotten the role of a lifetime, and how bleeding good he is as Paul Muad'Dib Usul! You get to see a wonderful transformation from him, and he is likely to take it to a whole new level in the upcoming Dune movies. Zendaya has given a great performance despite many limits to her character. Rebecca Ferguson will stun you with her deadly role in this one. Let me warn you, she is not the same Rebecca/Jessica you saw in Dune Part 1. So, be prepared for a surprise. Austin Butler fits well as a new antagonist, but I think he should have had more scenes. Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista were good in their roles, while the female side was well managed by Florence Pugh and Léa Seydoux. Christopher Walken and Stellen Skarsgard get some important scenes, and they show what experienced actors can do. Charlotte Rampling hardly shows her face, so I couldn't catch any expressions, but the voice tone was nice. Javier Bardem will go down as one of the best characters from Dune 2 for his involvement as a character and its growth as well. All those comic punches were hit by him only. Dune 2 has eye-pleasing cinematography (Greig Fraser) and a terrific background score by maestro Hans Zimmer. Joe Walker's editing keeps you on the edge of your seat despite the long runtime. I used to say that a long runtime doesn't hurt if it's Avatar 2 and Oppenheimer. Now, I'll add Dune 2 to that sentence. Keeping audiences interested in your story for 160 minutes is a big task nowadays. Dune 2 passes that litmus test too. Now, come to the captain of the ship, the master, the great Denis Villeneuve. I have been a huge fan of Incendies (2010), and I always believed that Villeneuve was better with such pathbreaking stories and thrillers, not grandeurs. Well, he proved me wrong, and I am so happy. Dune 2 comes as a testament that Denis can handle big-ticket entertainers too without hurting his content-loving fanbase. You may be a Marvel or a DC fan for their explosive entertainers, but the real "Marvel of a cinema" is here. Dune 2 has some outstanding war scenes that come with incredible vision and fantastic storytelling by the master filmmaker. In short, it's like Cameron meets Scorsese! I said it there, and I am so proud to say it. Overall, Dune 2 is stunning, incredible, wonderful, and anything close to whatever you call a modern-age sci-fi classic. Do yourself a favour and watch it in IMAX. The experience will shake you. RATING - 7.5/10*~7/10~28 February 2024
southdavid~Chip Spice please.~Intended to go and see "Dune: Part Two" in its opening weekend, but unfortunately I was unwell. I did manage to see it this weekend though and, whilst it's a long old film, I enjoyed it and it's never less than visually stunning. Following the destruction of House Atreides, the Harkonnen's retake control of Arrakis. Under Rabban (Dave Bautista) though they are unable to quell the attacks of the Fremen, which causes the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard) to replace him with his psychotic younger brother Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). Paul Atreides (Timonthee Chalamet) has joined the Fremen, who come to respect him, but he shies away from the prophecy of him being Kwisatz Haderach as he foresees billions of deaths if he rises to messianic power. I'm in a slightly strange scenario that my only complaint about "Dune: Part Two" would be that it feels it's length, but at the same time, I don't want to lose any of it. You have to accept, I think, that it's a long film and adjust your expectations accordingly as whilst it could perhaps have cut scenes to pick up the pace, there are levels of acceptance and plotting that benefit the film. Also because it's really good. It takes its time telling you the now somewhat tragic tale of Paul Atreides' reluctant seduction by power and his sacrifices in order to establish it. It's told as a story about the dangers of fundamentalism, especially when it's clearly told to us that the messiah prophecy is a story implanted by the Bene Gesserit. Visually it's another really strong film from Denis Villeneuve. It's more striking and impressive than some films with similar budgets get close too. The second half is stronger than the first, containing more of the battles with the final assault topping out the Harkonnen attack in Part One. It's great is the top line of the review, and I really hope that Villeneuve gets to conclude the trilogy he wants to make.~9/10~11 March 2024
MOscarbradley~Do we really need a Part Three?~When Denis Villeneuve decided to remake David Lynch's film "Dune", or rather adapt Frank Herbert's novel for the screen, he claimed there was too much material for just one film and that a "Dune Part Two" would follow. Well now it seems even a lengthy Part Two can't contain it all and it ends, like any other serial, with audiences hungry for what-happens-next. Or are they since Villeneuve's "Dune Part Two" is no "Star Wars" but an often ponderous meditation on the mystical, more Tarkovsky than George Lucas and whether audiences will really want to come back for more remains to be seen. Whereas Villeneuve's first "Dune" film was an exciting sci-fi adventure yarn, coupled with just the right amount of character development to draw audiences in, this second film seems to have dispensed with character development altogether, save for making its hero, Paul Atreides, (a glum Timothee Chalamet), arrogant and not very likeable. Instead it opts to go heavily into the quasi-religious mysticism hinted at in the first film, a plot device that only succeeds in weighing the film down and it isn't until close on the halfway mark it actually kicks off thanks in no small measure to Austin Butler's first appearance in a sequence filmed in black and white in a massive CGI arena. Butler is one of the villains of the piece and like the Devil he has all the best tunes. It isn't a big part but he steals every scene he's in. It's hardly great acting but it's definitely a star turn. For acting one must look to the great Stellan Skarsgard as the film's chief villain and perhaps to Charlotte Rampling but neither have sufficient screen time to make much of an impact. Visually, of course, it's a treat; a movie to be seen in cinemas on the largest screen possible. The action scenes are splendid and they do manage to keep boredom at bay but a third part? Surely not, Denis; "Dune Part Two" conjures up enough mystical gobbledygook to last a lifetime. Enough is enough.~6/10~15 March 2024
851222~Excellent film~Greetings from Lithuania. I liked "Dune: Part Two" (2024) more then a first part because for me at least it run faster, and pacing was near excellent. Don't get me wrong, first film is great but part 2 is better. The cast is amazing and their all did great job and they all are all in for material and directing. Music was superb and cinematography is Oscar worthy, again. And Part 2 felt less dreamy, the one thing is felt was overused in part 1. Overall, Dune 2 is an excellent, spectacular movie that has to be seen on biggest screen possible. Long, but superbly paced it left me wanting for the inevitable (hopefully) Part Three.~9/10~1 March 2024
Xstal~Scintillating Steam Punk Sci-Fi is Style Over Substance...~If you're looking for a film that's made of brilliance, that requires persistence and some resilience, that's often quite obscure, and has periods of chore, but is generally engaging, and punctilious. Packed with stars from round the world the cast is great, although old Walken may just get you vexed and grate, as will the nonsense words recited, Florence Pugh don't look delighted, and Stellan Skarsgård must have loved to post deflate. Although the worms are truly fantastic creations, if you've had them as a child they'd recall sensations, but these are really big, and would cause more than a jig, all in all it failed to meet, my expectations.~10/10~1 March 2024
jack_o_hasanov_imdb~Very Spicy~It was an epic movie. I am one of those who did not read the book. I was hesitant while watching the first movie, but I watched it anyway, and I was very impressed. But according to what I read, they made half of the first movie into a movie. I was excited for the second movie. I watched it in the cinema yesterday and liked it very much. Of course, I was expecting more epic movies. But still, it was not a disappointment. Everything was fine in the movie. Directing, cinematography, acting, music, editing, effects-everything was very good and worked meticulously. It seems that great importance was given to the sound editing of the film. Hans Zimmer wasn't bad, though. I don't like Timothée Chalamet very much in terms of acting, but he was very good in this movie. Everyone was very good. In fact, Zendaya was the weakest among them. But she was good, too. I was expecting the final battle scene to be more epic, but it was still very okay. Everyone in the cinema was watching with their mouths open. It was so epic. I like it.~7/10~2 March 2024
Jeremy_Urquhart~Woah~When you find yourself boarding the hype train, you run the risk of raising people's expectations too much. It's a reason I don't often like to give out perfect ratings straight away... but with Dune: Part Two, I can't think of any way it misstepped or let me down. This could be the best epic movie since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, or at least the most epic to successfully tell a story on this scale in a flawless way. For as good as 2021's Dune was, it just feels like a warm-up compared to Dune: Part Two, which is where things get bolder, more expansive, and much more morally complex. Dune is to Star Wars what Dune: Part Two is to The Empire Strikes Back; a basically perfect sequel to something that was already great, but is taken to new heights with a second installment. Dune: Part Two is also much better paced than the first movie, which has a lot of set-up to lay out early on, peaks at the end of its second act with a big battle sequence, and then has a slightly strange final act that now feels more like it functions as a prologue to Part Two. Dune: Part Two manages to kind of hit the ground running, but then wisely doesn't try to maintain a sprint all the way. It slows down where it needs to, and then continues to build to a final act that is mind-blowing in scale. I felt like I got goosebumps on my cheeks; I didn't even know you could get that feeling there. I also felt almost light-headed and overwhelmed, but in a good way. Seeing something on this scale pulled off this well comes just a handful of times a decade, if you're lucky. Timothee Chalamet is given much more to do, returning characters are taken to darker places that somehow feel both inevitable and surprising, the special effects are perfectly done, the new characters are great (Austin Butler comes amazingly close to overdoing it, but I feel like he's just the right level of unhinged), and the score/use of sound is incredible; as good or better than the first. Overall, it really does feel like an improvement across the board, wrapping up the first two movies well while giving some indication as to where things could go. It was a film that was worth the wait. Sorry in advance for adding to the hype, but I think it really was that good.~8/10~29 February 2024
PennyReviews~Good Enough~Dune: Part Two is the sequel to the sci fi movie Dune by Denis Villeneuve, based on the book of the same title. As an adaption, the movie does a good job delivering the story. It follows the book closely, though there were some differences that will probably be addressed in the third movie. The action scenes, moreover, were spot on, with impressive shots. The movie also doesn't overdo it with its fighting scenes, having them evenly spread throughout the movie and just long enough to not tire the viewer, who would have to sit for a nearly three hour long film. The performances were, in addition, great by everyone in the all start cast. However, there were some things that were lacking. First of all, the romance wasn't convincing, with an odd pacing, and lack of chemistry between the leads. Also, there way the unborn sister was presented was tiring after a while. In addition, the movie seemed to lean more into the cinematography and impressing the audience, then focusing on the storytelling. Hence, for someone who hasn't read the book, the movie will leave them with a lot of plotholes and with one dimentional characters. So, overall, seven out of ten, because it was visually pleasing, but not mesmerizing.~10/10~4 March 2024
henry8-3~Dune: Part 2~Continuing immediately from where part 1 left off, Paul (Timothy Chalamet) and his his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are taken back to the Fremen camp where, despite differing views on his messianic status, he is taught the ways of the desert. Whilst slowly adjusting to the notion that he might actually be the one, he starts rallying the troops for a push against evil House Harkonnen whilst Jessica replaces the tribe's dying reverend mother. The vile Baron meanwhile (Stellan Skarsgard) is unhappy with nephew Rabban's (Dave Bautista) progress on Arrakis and brings on board younger and nastier nephew Feyt (Austin Butler). More complex than part 1 with a good solid balance between the action scenes which are very impressive to look at (see it on the biggest screen you can) and progressing the belief or not, both by Paul and various Fremen, including new love Chani (Zendaya) as to whether he may be the one. Everyone in it gives a good account of themselves, although I particularly liked Florence Pugh, providing regular exposition as the Emperor's (Christopher Walken) insightful daughter Irulan, Rebecca Ferguson again as Jessica and again Stellan Skarsgard, hypnotic as the disgusting emperor. Chalamet also deserves credit. Not only does he lead from the front in 90% of the film, but he convincingly morphs from young boy to strong adult leader by the end of the film - he even ends up looking different. Plus of course, not since Ben Hur have there been so many hugely impressive crowd scenes, the desert scenes looks gorgeous and Zimmer's score remains mesmerising throughout. We all eagerly await Dune Messiah.~9/10~8 March 2024
cruise01~An epic second chapter that delivers a true cinematic experience.~5 out of 5 stars. Dune Part 2 is an awesome science fiction epic that delivers the next chapter in the series and it is one exciting cinematic experience. The director does an amazing job planning every sequence and action. Plus the visual effects are astonishing. Director Denis Villeneuve is one of the best as he plans every scene carefully and making each sequence a cinematic epic from fantastic cinematography that does great capturing the visuals and set pieces. The script is also incredible which continues with the story and world building. More new characters are introduced. Characters go through an arc. The pacing is fast. The film also felt like a middle chapter with a cliffhanger ending while tying up loose ends. Definitely excited to see another Dune 3 film by Denis Villenueve. The cast ensemble did a great job with there performances. The music score by Hans Zimmer was beautiful. The visual effects are amazing with breathtaking set pieces. The sandworms showing up in the climatic battle was epic that needs to be seen on the biggest screen. There is more action than the first. Better pacing. And more of an epic story. This is one of best films of the year. I cant wait for Dune 3.~7/10~5 March 2024
